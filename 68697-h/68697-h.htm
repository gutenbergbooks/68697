<p>Our experience with the American reading public
has taught us that it expects better reading than readers
of any other nationality. Why? Because Americans,
as a rule, are better educated and more intelligent.
We make it a point to cater to all classes of readers
with our paper-covered novels. If a man likes adventure
or detective stories, he can find more and better
ones in the S. &amp; S. novel list than he can among the
cloth books. If a woman wants love, society, or mystery
stories, the S. &amp; S. catalogue again contains just what
she wants at the lowest possible price. If a boy wants
up-to-date baseball, athletic, or treasure-hunt stories,
he cannot get anything that will please him so much
as the books in the <span class="smcap">Medal</span> and <span class="smcap">New Medal Libraries</span>,
no matter how much he has to spend for his reading
matter.</p>

a Chance?</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<hr class="tbd" />

<p>Most everybody thinks that the public library is a
mighty fine institution—teaches people to read, and all
that. Well, so it does, but does any one ever think of
the great risk that a person, who takes a book out of
a public library, runs of catching some contagious
disease?</p>

<p>Every time a bacteriological examination is made of
the public-library book, germs of every known disease
are found among its pages. Probably, from your own
experience, you know that lots of people never think
of taking a book from the public library, until some
one in their family is sick and wants something to read.</p>

<p>As records prove that ninety per cent of the demand
for books at the public libraries is for works of fiction,
it strikes us that the reading public would do better to
patronize the S. &amp; S. novel list which contains hundreds
of books to be found in the public libraries, and many
hundreds of others just as good and interesting.</p>

<p>The price of the S. &amp; S. novels is a low one indeed
to pay for protection from disease-laden literature.
Why run the risk, then, when you can get a fresh,
clean book for little money and thus insure your
health?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>THE MYSTERIOUS OLD MAN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Move on, old man, and go home!”</p>

<p>It was the stern voice of one of New York’s finest
policemen that uttered these words.</p>

<p>“Home! I wonder where it is?” muttered the old
man to whom the policeman had spoken, and a shudder
ran through his frame, as he slowly moved down
the street.</p>

<p>As he reached the corner near old St. John’s Church,
on Varick Street, he paused, rubbed his eyes and gazed
dreamily around him.</p>

<p>For some time before the policeman had addressed
him he had been standing inside the church, looking
through the railings into the churchyard.</p>

<p>His form was bent by decrepitude and sorrow, and
his hair was as white as the flaky snow that clung to
the steeple of the old church, the bells of which had
just sounded the knell of the dying year.</p>

<p>The old man only halted on the corner for a minute,
and then, crossing Beach Street, he shuffled along until
he reached the center of the block, where he came to a
standstill in front of an old-fashioned house, which
was unoccupied.</p>

<p>Then, as if a faintness had come over him, he
grasped the rusty iron railing to prevent himself falling
to the ground, and he closed his eyes, as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
the sight of the snow-covered houses was too much
for him.</p>

<p>The policeman had followed him at a distance, and
was watching him from where he was standing on the
corner.</p>

<p>“Poor devil!” muttered the guardian of the peace,
as he swung his nightstick back and forth. “I wonder
who he is! He seems weak! Perhaps at one time he
amounted to something. God save me from ever
coming to his condition. I wonder why he stands so
long in front of that old empty house, which has been
closed for twenty years, to my knowledge! I’ll watch
him a while, but I won’t molest him, poor devil!”</p>

<p>As the policeman concluded his soliloquy the old
man straightened up and walked up to the door of the
house, the old knocker on which he caught hold of
and gave it a rap.</p>

<p>But suddenly, as if struck by some painful recollection,
his hand fell to his side and he staggered back
to the middle of the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Strange,” the policeman ejaculated, noting this
action. “Perhaps he lived there at one time.”</p>

<p>The old man looked up at the house, at which he
gazed long and intently.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly arousing himself, he ambled back
to the corner, stopping near the policeman. He looked
confusedly around him, from the left to the right, and
the policeman gazed at him closely, but spoke not a
word. On his part, he did not seem to see the man in
uniform. He stood bewildered, appearing not to know
which way to turn.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go home, old man?” the policeman
asked, this time in a softened tone of voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>“Home!” the old fellow ejaculated—his voice was
like a wail, a heartbroken sob. “Home! where is it?”</p>

<p>“The Lord bless you, man, how can I tell you, if
you can’t tell yourself?”</p>

<p>“Twenty years ago—twenty years behind darkened
walls—and this——” He muttered the words in such
a forlorn tone that the policeman stared at him.</p>

<p>“Your brain is turned, old gentleman.”</p>

<p>The old man laughed and looked up into his questioner’s
face with a quizzical expression.</p>

<p>“My brain is clear, my friend,” he replied, in a clear,
harsh tone. “I have come from a prison—the world
is strangely altered since I was in it before.”</p>

<p>“In it before? Why, what do you mean? I suppose
you will try and persuade me that you have been dead
and have risen from the grave.”</p>

<p>“Figuratively speaking, I have—I have been dead
to the world—in prison at Sing Sing. Mark me well—Sing
Sing Prison—for twenty years—to-day I was
released. See me now. I am old, decrepit, hardly
able to walk. Once I stood erect, my hair was as black
as the raven’s wing, and now—look at me, a wreck
without home or friends. Wife, children, all gone!
I have never seen nor heard of them since the day I
was taken out of yonder house a prisoner, by the unjust,
hard, and cruel decree of a so-called court of
justice. Twenty years! A prisoner, buried alive, as
it were.”</p>

<p>“You had committed a crime?”</p>

<p>“No. I was innocent, but powerful conspirators
plotted against me—the evidence was perjured—and
I—I—was entombed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>“You say you lived in yonder house twenty years
ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and no man carried his head higher than I
did. I was rich—but bah! what is the use of rehearsing
those things to a stranger! Hardened as you are
by association with crime, you would not believe my
story. You would think that I was romancing. Things
have sadly changed in this neighborhood.”</p>

<p>“You may bet they have.”</p>

<p>“Once all these houses were occupied by rich people,
but to-day they are the abodes of the poor and the
outcast.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“My name! It matters not. Good night.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, keep your secret, old man. God bless
you, and may this new year bring you happiness.”</p>

<p>“Happiness! I shall never know that again. Good
night, again.”</p>

<p>He moved off slowly, and the policeman watched
him until he turned the corner into West Broadway,
when he proceeded to patrol his beat.</p>

<p>As the policeman moved away, a dark form came
out of a near-by doorway and hurried around the
corner.</p>

<p>The man was tall, he wore a long ulster with the
collar turned up around his neck, and a slouch hat was
pulled down over his eyes. He followed closely in
the old man’s trail.</p>

<p>The old man halted several times, and as he did so
his form seemed to lose its decrepitude. As the light
from the street lamps shone upon his face it could
be seen that his eyes glared like two living coals; he
threw his hand aloft, and so fierce and startling was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
the action that the man who was following him halted
and shrank back for an instant, as if he had been
struck.</p>

<p>“Vengeance!” the old man hissed, and then he
started on again.</p>

<p>The street was deserted, save by the old man and
the man who was following him.</p>

<p>The former walked on, looking up at the tall warehouses
and store buildings, muttering to himself.</p>

<p>More than once he put his hand up to his head and
gazed about in a bewildered manner.</p>

<p>His limbs shook under him, for a long time had
passed since they had been used to such exertion.</p>

<p>The fresh air came so strangely upon him that he
panted for breath.</p>

<p>Suddenly he halted in front of an old-fashioned
three-story brick building near Chambers Street. A
beacon-shaped red lamp was burning over the doorway,
and upon the front pane of glass was painted:</p>

<p class="center">THE RED DRAGON INN.<br />

Established by William Sill—1776.</p>

<p>It was an old landmark in the neighborhood, and it
had always been a hostelry. In revolutionary times it
was a post roadhouse, and was famous as the headquarters
of many of the British officers. During later
days it became the resort, at the noonday hour, of
many of New York’s most staid and solid merchants,
whose places of business were in the vicinity.</p>

<p>At this time the ground floor was occupied by a
man who ran a saloon and restaurant, and who rented
out the upstairs rooms to transient lodgers. No improvements
had been made about the place, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
stood just as it did when it was conducted by its
original owner.</p>

<p>As the old man paused in front of the inn the sound
of voices and the clinking of glasses came from within.
He walked up to the door and opened it. Then he
stepped into the saloon, staggered up to the bar and,
in a low tone, ordered a glass of toddy, which was
supplied to him.</p>

<p>A number of men were seated at the tables, drinking,
and none of them paid any attention to the newcomer,
who drank his toddy while standing and leaning
against the bar.</p>

<p>The old man placed his empty glass back upon the
counter, and facing the bartender, said:</p>

<p>“I want a room for the night.”</p>

<p>“There is only one empty,” the bartender replied.
“It is in the attic.”</p>

<p>“That will answer my purpose.”</p>

<p>“It will cost you one dollar.”</p>

<p>The old man drew a purse out of his pocket, took
out the amount, and handed it to the bartender, who
asked:</p>

<p>“Do you want to retire now?”</p>

<p>“I do,” the old man answered.</p>

<p>“I will show you the way up.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be necessary. I am familiar with every
room in the house. Many a time I have stopped here
in other days. If you will tell me which room I am
to occupy, I will go up to it.”</p>

<p>“The second room in the back part of the attic on
the left of the stairway is the one. You will find a
lamp on a table in the hall on the second floor.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>The old man left the room, while the bartender
gazed after him with curiosity. He climbed the stairway
and reached the second floor, where he found the
lamp, and then proceeded upstairs to the attic room.</p>

<p>An hour after he retired, the house was silent, all
the midnight revelers having gone home, and the bartender
having closed up the saloon.</p>

<p>New Year’s Day dawned bright and clear.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the Red Dragon Inn opened the
barroom, and at nine o’clock the bartender came downstairs.</p>

<p>For a time the two men stood talking.</p>

<p>There were no customers in the place.</p>

<p>At last the bartender asked the proprietor if he
had seen anything of the strange old man who had
come in after midnight.</p>

<p>The proprietor said that the old man had not appeared.</p>

<p>“Did he request you to call him?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“No,” the bartender answered. “Shall I go up and
ask him if he wants breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The bartender ascended to the attic.</p>

<p>The door of the room which the old man had been
assigned to stood ajar.</p>

<p>The man knocked, but there was no answer. He
pounded again and shouted. Still no answer. Finally
the man pushed the door open. A terrible sight met
his gaze. Stretched out upon the bed he beheld the
old man, with his throat cut from ear to ear. His
hands were folded across his breast, and he was covered
by the coverlet of the bed. Evidently there had
been no struggle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>The bartender uttered a cry of alarm, but he did
not enter the room.</p>

<p>As soon as he recovered from his surprise he dashed
off downstairs, crying “Murder!” at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p>Instantly the house was aroused, and in a short time
a great crowd congregated in the street in front of
the door.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>SEARCHING FOR CLEWS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Early on New Year’s morning Nicholas Carter, the
famous detective, arrived in Jersey City on a train
from Chicago, where he had been investigating a diamond
case, which he had closed up successfully.</p>

<p>Danny, his chauffeur, met him at the station, with
his powerful touring car; and in a few minutes they
were crossing the Hudson River on the downtown
ferry over to Chambers Street.</p>

<p>They had just landed and were beginning to get
headway along that thoroughfare, when their attention
was attracted by a loud commotion in the street.</p>

<p>Leaning over, Carter beheld the crowd congregating
in front of the Red Dragon Inn, which was almost
opposite. He heard the cries of murder.</p>

<p>Instantly the veteran’s energies were aroused. He
forgot all about his not having had breakfast, and
springing out, he pushed his way through the crowd
and entered the barroom of the Red Dragon Inn.</p>

<p>There he found the proprietor pacing up and down
in a state of nervous excitement.</p>

<p>A policeman was also there, and to him Nick applied
for information.</p>

<p>“I can’t make head nor tail of it,” the policeman
replied to Carter’s inquiry. “I’ve sent word to the
police station, Mr. Carter, and I am expecting the
captain every minute.”</p>

<p>“Have you been upstairs?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I thought it best to wait until the captain
arrived.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“Where is the bartender?”</p>

<p>“Standing over there,” and the policeman pointed to
the man, who was leaning against the bar.</p>

<p>Carter stepped up to the bartender and asked:</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“George Terry,” the bartender answered.</p>

<p>“How long have you been employed here?”</p>

<p>“Three years.”</p>

<p>“I believe you discovered the murder?”</p>

<p>“I did, sir.”</p>

<p>“At what time?”</p>

<p>“About twenty minutes ago.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the man?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, he is a stranger to me.”</p>

<p>“What is his name?”</p>

<p>“I forgot to ask him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you keep a register?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“What time did the man arrive?”</p>

<p>“Shortly after midnight.”</p>

<p>“Did he have any luggage?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Tell me all about your conversation with him.”</p>

<p>“As I said, he came in here shortly after midnight.
He seemed weak and exhausted as he slipped up to
the bar. He requested me to make him a hot toddy,
which I did.</p>

<p>“After he had finished his drink he asked me if I
could let him have a room for the night, and I told
him that the attic room was vacant and he could have
that. He paid the price out of a well-filled purse.</p>

<p>“I offered to conduct him up to the room, Mr.
Carter, but he said it would not be necessary, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
he was familiar with the house, he having stopped here
on various occasions twenty years ago. He left the
room, and that was the last I saw of him until I discovered
his murdered body, when I went up to the
attic to call him and opened the door of the room he
occupied.”</p>

<p>“You heard him say he had stopped here on various
occasions twenty years ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“What is the proprietor’s name?”</p>

<p>“Henry Lancaster.”</p>

<p>“How long has he conducted this place?”</p>

<p>“Ten years.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the name of the man from whom
he purchased it?”</p>

<p>“I do not.”</p>

<p>“Has any one been upstairs to the murdered man’s
room since you made the discovery?”</p>

<p>“No one has been near it. Everything is undisturbed.
I did not enter.”</p>

<p>“I will speak to the proprietor.”</p>

<p>Carter approached Mr. Lancaster, who was a middle-aged
man of affable manners.</p>

<p>“The bartender informs me that you have conducted
this place for about ten years,” the detective said, as he
came up to Mr. Lancaster.</p>

<p>“I have owned it for nearly eleven years,” Mr. Lancaster
replied.</p>

<p>“From whom did you purchase it?”</p>

<p>“A man named Peter Wright, who had been the
proprietor for nearly a quarter of a century.”</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Wright alive?”</p>

<p>“He is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“Where does he reside?”</p>

<p>“At the Cosmopolitan Hotel, across the street. He
is a bachelor, and entirely alone in the world, all of
his relatives having died. He is an Englishman by
birth, and a courtly old gentleman. He has a moderate
income to live on, and he is enjoying himself in his
declining years. All of the merchants of old New
York knew him, and when he conducted the Red
Dragon Inn it was famous as a chop house.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wright’s acquaintance is extensive,” added
Lancaster. “If you see him, he may know something
about the murdered man—if the man spoke the truth
when he said that he used to stop here twenty years
ago.</p>

<p>“I shall surely call upon Mr. Wright, and ask him
to take a look at the remains.”</p>

<p>At this moment Carter felt a heavy hand laid upon
his shoulder. He turned around and beheld the captain
of the precinct, who had just arrived.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, Mr. Carter,” the officer exclaimed.
“You can help us in this, and as usual I
suppose you have gleaned considerable information?”</p>

<p>“I have found very little,” the detective replied.</p>

<p>“Will you help us?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“My mind is relieved. I hope you’ll take full charge
of the case.”</p>

<p>“What about headquarters?”</p>

<p>“I will take care of that. While you have charge,
the people at headquarters will not interfere.”</p>

<p>“Have you sent out an alarm?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“Let us go up to the attic room. Request your
men to keep every one downstairs.”</p>

<p>“I will do that.”</p>

<p>The police captain issued his instructions to his
men, and then he and Carter proceeded upstairs to the
attic room in which the body of the victim lay.</p>

<p>The captain stood out in the hall on the threshold,
while the detective entered the room.</p>

<p>Carter stepped up to the side of the bed and scrutinized
the face of the victim closely in silence.</p>

<p>“His throat was cut while he slept,” Nick remarked,
looking toward the captain.</p>

<p>“Do you see any sign of the weapon with which
the crime was committed?” the police official asked.</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>Carter turned around and commenced to inspect the
room.</p>

<p>For nearly fifteen minutes he was engaged in the
work, without uttering a word.</p>

<p>The police captain watched him with close attention.</p>

<p>The detective went over the ground with the avidity
of a sleuthhound scenting for a trail.</p>

<p>Every nook and corner of the apartment was inspected,
until the detective stood by the window, the
sash of which was raised. He looked at the sill and
then uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“What is it?” the police captain asked, entering
the room and stepping up to Carter’s side.</p>

<p>“See,” the detective replied, pointing with his forefinger
to stains upon the window sill and the lower
part of the sash. “Here are imprints of bloody fingers.
The murderer, after he committed the crime, came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
over to this window and raised the sash. And here
are bloody tracks on the outside. Look; there are
imprints of shoes in the snow across the roof—they
lead from here to the edge. The murderer escaped
this way. Wait here.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“You’ll see.”</p>

<p>Carter crawled out of the window onto the roof,
and followed the tracks in the snow, until he came to
the edge of the roof, where he halted and looked over.</p>

<p>There, attached to the side of the house, he beheld
an iron ladder leading from the roof down to the
yard.</p>

<p>Still he saw nothing of the weapon with which the
crime had been committed.</p>

<p>There was no doubt now in his mind about the
assassin having escaped by the roof. He returned to
the room and gave the captain an accurate but brief
account of what he had discovered.</p>

<p>“This leads me to think the murderer possessed
some knowledge of this house,” the police captain
remarked, after he had listened to what the detective
had to say.</p>

<p>“Probably,” Carter rejoined, and then for a time
he lapsed into deep thought.</p>

<p>The captain was also silent.</p>

<p>Nick’s eyes wandered around the room and he bit
his lips.</p>

<p>Upon his face there was a strained expression.</p>

<p>One could tell that he was following some train
of thought.</p>

<p>The pupils of his eyes blazed brilliantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>Minute after minute passed and still he did not
speak.</p>

<p>Patiently his companion waited.</p>

<p>Carter’s eyes rested upon the clothing of the victim,
which was lying on a chair near the bed in a
corner of the room.</p>

<p>It was in a confused heap.</p>

<p>The detective stepped forward.</p>

<p>“We have overlooked these!” he exclaimed, pointing
to the clothes.</p>

<p>“I was just looking at them,” the police captain
remarked. “It seems to me that they must have been
disturbed by the murderer.”</p>

<p>“They were,” Carter rejoined, holding up the dead
man’s vest for the police captain to inspect. “There
are bloodstains upon this and the other garments.”</p>

<p>“Search the pockets.”</p>

<p>For some minutes the detective was engaged in
making the search. When he finished he looked at the
captain.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” he said tersely.</p>

<p>“The murderer secured everything,” the police captain
rejoined, in a tone of disappointment, “he has not
left a scrap of paper by which the dead man could be
identified.”</p>

<p>“Everything is gone.”</p>

<p>“It is too bad.”</p>

<p>“Yes—but I have made a discovery.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“These are prison clothes—they are new.”</p>

<p>“What! Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“I am positive. They were made in Sing Sing
Prison.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“And what is your conclusion?”</p>

<p>“This murdered man was recently released from
State’s prison.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the motive for the crime was revenge.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, and still he may have been murdered because
he possessed information which some one was
afraid would be divulged.”</p>

<p>“That may be it.”</p>

<p>“In one way this discovery is important.”</p>

<p>“And you really think this man was a convict?”</p>

<p>“I do. If he were not a released convict he would
not have worn clothing made expressly for the convicts.”</p>

<p>“He may have purchased them from some one.”</p>

<p>“That is so—but still I think he did not.”</p>

<p>“There is one clew anyway.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Let us go downstairs.”</p>

<p>They left the room.</p>

<p>Carter closed and locked the door.</p>

<p>On the way downstairs the detective inspected the
steps, but he found nothing which would throw any
light upon the mystery. There were no tracks, except
those in the snow on the roof. The leading question
in his mind was how the murderer had entered the
house.</p>

<p>After he had returned to the barroom he called the
bartender aside and asked:</p>

<p>“Do you remember if any one came in after the
old man retired?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, now that I come to think of it,” the
bartender exclaimed, with considerable animation. “A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
tall man entered just as the old man left the room.
He wore a long ulster and a slouch hat.</p>

<p>“This man, sir, stepped up to the bar and called
for whisky, which I served to him. He took a seat
at a table near the hall door.</p>

<p>“I was busy supplying the orders to the other customers
and I did not pay any attention to him.</p>

<p>“When I came to close up he was gone.</p>

<p>“When he went out, I do not know; but he may
have left while I was serving drinks at some one of
the tables.”</p>

<p>“Would you know the man if you should see him
again?” inquired the detective.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell whether I would or not.”</p>

<p>“Are you able to describe him?”</p>

<p>“I should think he was about forty-five or fifty
years old. His face was covered with a heavy brown
beard. His eyes were black, restless and penetrating.
That is all I can remember about him. I didn’t pay
particular attention to him.”</p>

<p>“Who occupied the room next to the one in which
the man was murdered?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“What time did you retire?”</p>

<p>“It was probably about half past one o’clock. As I
was about to enter my room I noticed that a light
was burning in the old man’s room. I thought at the
time that he had not yet retired, but I didn’t hear him
make any noise.”</p>

<p>“You were not awakened during the night?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Are you a sound sleeper?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“What time did you get up?”</p>

<p>“About half past eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>Carter went out into the back yard.</p>

<p>There he found footprints in the snow leading from
the foot of the ladder over to a gate in the fence,
which opened to an alley running along between the
yards into Hudson Street.</p>

<p>The trail was plain and distinct.</p>

<p>The detective followed it until it ended on Hudson
Street.</p>

<p>Then he returned to the yard, where he made a
search for the weapon, thinking the assassin might
have thrown it away.</p>

<p>But there was no trace of it to be found.</p>

<p>Carter went back into the barroom.</p>

<p>The coroner had arrived and was preparing to take
charge of the body.</p>

<p>The detective hurried across the street to the Cosmopolitan
Hotel and asked to see Mr. Wright, the
former proprietor of the Red Dragon Inn.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright was a portly old gentleman with a
large, florid, jovial face, and he received the detective
instantly. He listened attentively to what Carter had
to say, and he complied with his request to accompany
him over to the inn and view the remains of the
victim.</p>

<p>“If that man spoke the truth,” Mr. Wright remarked,
as he and the detective left the hotel, “I may
be able to identify the body.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>THE IDENTIFICATION.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Carter conducted Peter Wright upstairs to the attic
room in which the body of the victim lay.</p>

<p>The coroner was making an examination, but he
stepped aside, so as to allow Mr. Wright to see the
face of the murdered man.</p>

<p>The former proprietor of the Red Dragon Inn
looked at the ghastly white countenance long and intently.</p>

<p>All of the persons in the room watched him in
silence.</p>

<p>Several times the old man shook his head back and
forth and his brow became contracted.</p>

<p>Finally he looked at Carter and shook his head
dolefully.</p>

<p>“There is a certain familiar expression about that
man’s features,” he said, in a tone of awe, “but for
the life of me I cannot recall who he is. If he were
a patron of the Red Dragon Inn while I was proprietor,
he has changed so that I cannot remember
him.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry that you are not able to identify
the body, Mr. Wright,” the detective said. “Will you
kindly accompany me downstairs. I want to have a
private talk with you.”</p>

<p>“Lead on, and I will follow.”</p>

<p>The detective led the way down to the parlor.</p>

<p>As soon as they were inside the room he closed the
door. Presently he and Mr. Wright were ensconced
in easy-chairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“Permit your memory to wander back ten or twelve
years to the time when you owned this place, and see
if you can recall the name of any one of your patrons
who was sent to State’s prison.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wright started.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Carter smiled and his eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“What startles you?” the detective asked, with an
assumed air of surprise.</p>

<p>“Nothing startles me,” Mr. Wright rejoined.</p>

<p>“Then what is it?”</p>

<p>“That man is Alfred Lawrence—he has changed
mightily—it is no wonder I did not recognize him.
But I know him now.”</p>

<p>“Who was Alfred Lawrence?”</p>

<p>“He was one of my old customers. He was sent to
Sing Sing for fifteen years for forgery. Don’t you
remember the famous Lawrence will case?”</p>

<p>“I have a slight recollection of it. The trial took
place while I was away in Europe, and I read very
little about it.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you about it.”</p>

<p>“Do so.”</p>

<p>“Alfred Lawrence was a well-to-do produce
merchant, who had an office on West Street and lived
on Beach Street.</p>

<p>“His uncle, after whom he was named, was the
senior member of the firm. Old Alfred Lawrence was
a bachelor.</p>

<p>“When he died a will was found, and in it he left
all his estate to his nephew.</p>

<p>“Simeon Rich, another nephew, and his sister contested
the will. They claimed that it was a forgery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
and that Alfred Lawrence had forged his uncle’s signature.</p>

<p>“The case came up before the surrogate and the fight
was a bitter one on both sides.</p>

<p>“Lawrence’s wife, with whom he had lived unhappily,
went before the referee and swore that she had
seen her husband forge the will. Her testimony was
corroborated by Blanchard, the chief witness, who was
Lawrence’s butler.</p>

<p>“It was hinted at, at the time, that Mrs. Lawrence
and Simeon Rich were very intimate.</p>

<p>“The will was broken. Lawrence was arrested,
tried, convicted, and sent to State’s prison.</p>

<p>“Then people forgot all about him.”</p>

<p>“What became of Mrs. Lawrence?” asked Carter.</p>

<p>“She lived for a time in the Beach Street house.
A year after her husband’s conviction the house was
closed up and Mrs. Lawrence and her child disappeared.
The house has remained closed ever since.”</p>

<p>“Then there was a child?”</p>

<p>“Yes—a girl—she was about twelve years old at
the time.”</p>

<p>“What became of Simeon Rich?”</p>

<p>“I do not know.”</p>

<p>“How was the estate divided?”</p>

<p>“That I do not remember.”</p>

<p>“Lawrence, you say, was a customer of yours?”</p>

<p>“He was, and he was a mighty fine fellow. I always
believed he was innocent, notwithstanding the fact
that all the evidence was strong against him.”</p>

<p>“And you believe that the murdered man is this same
Alfred Lawrence?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“Is this all the information you can give me, Mr.
Wright?”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“What was the number of the old house on Beach
Street in which Lawrence resided?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember, but you can find it easily. It is
near Varick Street, and it is the only house on the
block that is closed.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>“Some one is at the door,” said Peter Wright.</p>

<p>Carter arose from his chair and opened the door.</p>

<p>The police captain entered the room, followed by a
policeman.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter,” he said, “here is one of my men,
Officer Pat Maguire; he saw the murdered man last
night.”</p>

<p>“Did he?” Carter queried, casting a searching glance
at Maguire, who replied:</p>

<p>“That I did, sir.”</p>

<p>“Sit down and tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>Pat Maguire took a seat.</p>

<p>“This morning,” he said, “I reported at the station
house and I heard about the murder. The instant I
heard a description of the man read I concluded it
was the poor, forlorn, down-and-out old chap with
whom I had talked last night while on my beat.</p>

<p>“I came around here, took a look at the body, and
I saw that it was the old man. Then I instantly told
the captain about the conversation I had with him, and
he brought me here to see you.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about that conversation, Maguire.”</p>

<p>Policeman Maguire gave Carter a clear account of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the conversation which he had held with the old man
and described how he had acted.</p>

<p>When he concluded, Mr. Wright ejaculated:</p>

<p>“You see, Mr. Carter, that corroborates what I told
you. There are no reasonable doubts now about the
man being Alfred Lawrence.”</p>

<p>“Why did he try to enter that house on Beach
Street?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell.”</p>

<p>“There is a deep mystery here,” remarked Carter,
“one which I intend to solve. Gentlemen, I must leave
you. Please keep silent about what you have told
me.”</p>

<p>Before any one could utter a word, he had slipped
out of the room.</p>

<p>“A strange man,” the police captain remarked, as
soon as Carter was gone. “Why has he left the room
without giving any intimation of what he was going
to do?”</p>

<p>The information which had been imparted to Carter
by Mr. Wright and the policeman was important. He
was certain now that the murdered man was the ex-convict,
Alfred Lawrence.</p>

<p>It was his intention to probe into that man’s history
and learn more of the details of the will case and the
trial.</p>

<p>In doing this, would he be able to discover the motive
of the murder?</p>

<p>After leaving the Red Dragon Inn the detective at
once—without waiting to go home—went to a near-by
telephone exchange and called up the keeper of Sing
Sing Prison.</p>

<p>From this man he learned that Lawrence had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
released early the day before, that he had been
furnished with clothing and a small sum of money,
and that he started for New York.</p>

<p>“What train did he leave on?” Carter asked of the
keeper.</p>

<p>“The eleven-ten,” the keeper replied.</p>

<p>“Was he an exemplary prisoner?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Did he have any visitors call on him?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“During his imprisonment, did he receive many
letters?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“Did he ever talk to you about himself?”</p>

<p>“No, he was always a taciturn man and he never
talked to me or to others about himself. When he
left here yesterday he said that he intended to be revenged
on the persons who had wronged him, for, he
said, he had suffered for a crime of which he was not
guilty.”</p>

<p>“Did he mention any names?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“How much money did you give him?”</p>

<p>“Ten dollars.”</p>

<p>From the telephone office the detective went in his
automobile to the old house on Beach Street. He stood
on the sidewalk and inspected it. There was no sign
on the house to indicate that the formerly handsome
residence was for rent or for sale. All the windows
were boarded up tight.</p>

<p>A man, who lived next door, noticed Carter, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
coming up to his side, coughed nervously, to attract
his attention.</p>

<p>“Are you thinking of buying or renting this place?”</p>

<p>“Is it for sale?” the detective asked, without answering
the man’s question.</p>

<p>“I do not know. I thought from the manner in
which you were looking at it that you thought about
renting or buying it. No sign has ever been up on
the house.”</p>

<p>“How long have you lived in this neighborhood?”</p>

<p>“About twenty years.”</p>

<p>“Then you are pretty well acquainted with it?”</p>

<p>“That I am.”</p>

<p>“How long has this house been uninhabited?”</p>

<p>“About ten years, I think.”</p>

<p>“Were you acquainted with the last tenant?”</p>

<p>“I was. Alfred Lawrence and his family lived
there. Lawrence was sent to State’s prison on a charge
of forgery. His wife and child moved away, and
from that day to this I never heard what became of
them.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen any one visit the house?”</p>

<p>“No one has ever come here.”</p>

<p>“Was the furniture taken away?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then the house is evidently empty?”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“Were you acquainted with Lawrence enough to
know anything about his affairs?”</p>

<p>“I was not.”</p>

<p>“All I know is what I read in the newspapers at
the time.”</p>

<p>“Was he a man of considerable means?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“I always thought so.”</p>

<p>“Did you know Simeon Rich?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Not being able to secure any further information
from the man, the detective walked away.</p>

<p>Many thoughts crowded his mind and he asked himself
innumerable questions in regard to the case.</p>

<p>The prison keeper had told him over the telephone
that Lawrence had only ten dollars in his possession
when he left Sing Sing, and the bartender at the
Red Dragon Inn had informed him that the man who
had been murdered had displayed a large sum of money
when he paid for the night’s lodging.</p>

<p>“From whom had Lawrence received money?” the
detective asked himself as he pondered over this. “He
must have got money from some one.”</p>

<p>That was clear.</p>

<p>But the bartender might have been mistaken.</p>

<p>Nick told Danny to drive to a restaurant, where he
procured an excellent breakfast; then he directed the
chauffeur to make a dash up to the Grand Central
Station, where he hoped to find some one who had
seen Lawrence leave the train and had noted the direction
in which he went.</p>

<p>What had Lawrence done from the time he left
the depot until Pat Maguire saw him standing in front
of St. John’s Church looking into the churchyard?</p>

<p>Would the detective be able to follow his footsteps?</p>

<p>Many would have looked upon such a task as Carter
had set out to perform as hopeless.</p>

<p>The railroad detective who was stationed at the
depot was unable to furnish Nick with any information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>Carter made inquiries of the porters and others, but
none of them remembered seeing any man who answered
to Lawrence’s description.</p>

<p>Finally, he left the depot and went outside to the
cab stand.</p>

<p>Here he commenced to question the drivers.</p>

<p>At last he found a man who, in reply to his question,
said:</p>

<p>“I drove the old chap downtown in my cab.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you would be able to identify him
if you should see him again?” Carter asked.</p>

<p>“I do,” the cabman answered.</p>

<p>“Will you come with me?”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“I want you to take a look at a man and see if he
is the same person whom you drove downtown.”</p>

<p>“I can’t leave my cab.”</p>

<p>“Drive me down to the Cosmopolitan Hotel.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that.”</p>

<p>Nick sent Danny home, got into the cab, and was
driven away.</p>

<p>He had his reasons for not telling the cabman anything
about the case.</p>

<p>Before he questioned him further he wanted to see
if the murdered man was the same person whom the
man had had for a fare the previous day.</p>

<p>The cab stopped in front of the Cosmopolitan Hotel
and the detective alighted. He and the driver crossed
the street and entered the Red Dragon Inn.</p>

<p>To the chamber of death the detective conducted his
surprised companion.</p>

<p>When they entered the room Carter pointed to the
corpse and asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Is that the man?”</p>

<p>“Dead!” the cabman ejaculated, as he started back,
after having glanced at the face of the murdered man.
“Yes, sir, it is the man, all right. He has been murdered!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Did you fetch me down here to place me under
arrest?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about this.”</p>

<p>“Come with me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you, but I swear——”</p>

<p>“There, there, my man, don’t get excited. You will
not be arrested—rest easy on that score.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“Wait until we get outside, and then I will tell you
what I want you to do.”</p>

<p>They returned to the cab and stood on the sidewalk
near it.</p>

<p>Carter was silent for a short time.</p>

<p>Suddenly he looked up into the pale face of the
cabman and asked:</p>

<p>“Where did you drive him?”</p>

<p>“You mean——” the man stammered. The question
had been asked so suddenly that he was slightly confused.</p>

<p>“I mean the man whose body lies over there in the
Red Dragon Inn.”</p>

<p>“I drove him down to the Manhattan Safe Deposit
Company. He got out of the cab, told me to wait for
him, and then he went into the building, where he
remained for nearly half an hour. When he came out
he paid and dismissed me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“When he paid you did he display any large amount
of money?”</p>

<p>“He had quite a large-sized roll of bills in his hand.”</p>

<p>“Did you drive away immediately after you received
the money for your services?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“And you did not notice in which direction the
old man went?”</p>

<p>“He went back into the building.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>A PECULIAR INTERVIEW.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Carter lapsed into silence after the cabman had answered
his last question.</p>

<p>It was clear to him now that Lawrence had secured
money at the Manhattan Safe Deposit Company.</p>

<p>Did he get the money out of a box, which he owned,
or from some one connected with the company?</p>

<p>The detective proposed to find out. He happened to
be acquainted with the cashier of the safe deposit
company, so he ordered the cabman to drive him to
the gentleman’s house.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Carter found the cashier at home, and
he was received by him in his library.</p>

<p>“Were you acquainted with an Alfred Lawrence?”
the detective inquired of the cashier as soon as he was
seated.</p>

<p>The gentleman started in surprise, and asked:</p>

<p>“Why do you ask that question?”</p>

<p>“I want information,” Carter replied, with a smile.
He paused for a moment, and then he continued: “I
can see from the manner in which you started that you
knew Alfred Lawrence.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did know Alfred Lawrence, and I always
regarded him as an honest man. In spite of the fact
that he was tried and found guilty of forgery, I have
always believed he was innocent. But why do you
come here asking about Lawrence?”</p>

<p>“Lawrence was murdered at the Red Dragon Inn
early this morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“No! It can’t be true!”</p>

<p>The gentleman bounded out of his chair and, standing
in the center of the room, gazed at Carter with
an expression of astonishment upon his face.</p>

<p>“It is true, nevertheless,” the detective replied.</p>

<p>“I saw him yesterday. He had just been released
from Sing Sing Prison.”</p>

<p>“Please be seated and try to be calm. I want you to
recall to your mind all that occurred yesterday between
you and Lawrence. It is important that you
should remember everything.”</p>

<p>“I will try and do as you request.”</p>

<p>The gentleman resumed his seat, and for some time
he bowed his head, resting it upon his hand.</p>

<p>The detective remained quiet.</p>

<p>Patiently he waited for the cashier of the safe deposit
company to speak. He desired to let him have
plenty of time in which to recall to his mind all that
had happened between him and the murdered man on
the previous day.</p>

<p>Finally the gentleman raised his head and gazed
intently into Carter’s face.</p>

<p>“This is a great shock to me,” he remarked, as he
passed his hand over his forehead. “Lawrence came
into my office about two o’clock.</p>

<p>“At first I did not recognize him on account of the
great change that had been wrought in him.</p>

<p>“When I learned who he was I was glad to see
him.</p>

<p>“He sat down and told me about his prison experience.</p>

<p>“In years gone by we had been friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“When he was tried I did what I could to help him.</p>

<p>“The evidence was too strong against him, and he
was convicted.</p>

<p>“When he was sent to prison he left in my care
some securities to dispose of. I sold them and placed
the money on deposit with the Bank of North
America.</p>

<p>“I wrote to him about it, and he said that he desired
me not to communicate with him again until he should
be free. Then he would call upon me. If I were to
die I was to provide in my will that the money should
be placed with some trust company for him.</p>

<p>“Well, as I said, he called on me yesterday. He
asked me for two hundred dollars, and I gave it to
him.”</p>

<p>The gentleman paused.</p>

<p>“How much was the full amount?” asked Nick,
upon whom the cashier’s information was making a
clear impression of innocence on the part of Alfred
Lawrence.</p>

<p>“About seven thousand dollars,” the cashier answered.</p>

<p>“Did Lawrence talk about his family?”</p>

<p>“He did not.”</p>

<p>“Did he talk about any one?”</p>

<p>“All he said was that he intended to prove that he
was not a forger.”</p>

<p>“Did he say how he was going to do it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Were you ever acquainted with Simeon Rich?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Is he living in the city?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“And you don’t know what became of Lawrence’s
wife and child?”</p>

<p>“I do not.”</p>

<p>“Did you know that Lawrence’s house on Beach
Street has remained vacant for years?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“When Lawrence left you did he say where he
was going?”</p>

<p>“He did not.”</p>

<p>“Did he say that he would call on you again?”</p>

<p>“He promised to call and see me to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Did Lawrence run a safe deposit box?”</p>

<p>“He did. He had one with our company.”</p>

<p>“Did he open it yesterday?”</p>

<p>“No. He told me that he intended to open it to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Did he have the key?”</p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the number of the box?”</p>

<p>“I do not.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow I will find out the number for you.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you do so to-day?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I want to examine the contents of that box.”</p>

<p>“You will have to wait until to-morrow, Mr. Carter.
Then I will get permission for you to open the box.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I’ll have to wait.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry that I can’t help you to-day.”</p>

<p>“So am I.”</p>

<p>Carter gave the cashier an account of the mysterious
murder at the Red Dragon Inn and then he departed,
promising to call on him at his office early the next
morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>So far he had progressed fairly well with the case,
though he had not secured any information which
would throw light on the mystery.</p>

<p>The murdered man’s identity was established and
Carter had learned something about his history.</p>

<p>But that was not much.</p>

<p>Who could have committed the crime?</p>

<p>Was Lawrence murdered by a common thief or by
one who was afraid of him and desired to put him
out of the way?</p>

<p>Carter asked himself these questions.</p>

<p>He was not prepared to answer either one of them.</p>

<p>He had discovered no clew.</p>

<p>He had learned nothing upon which he could base
a theory.</p>

<p>Leaving the cashier’s house, he dismissed the cabman,
and, hailing a taxicab, rode home, where he went
to his study and sat down to smoke and think.</p>

<p>It was now evening. He had not wasted a moment
since early in the morning, but he was not satisfied
with his work. He had looked through the directory
and had not been able to find in it the name of the
man who had been instrumental in sending Lawrence
to State’s prison.</p>

<p>Did he have any suspicion that that man could have
anything to do with the murder?</p>

<p>If he did not, then why was he so anxious to find
out what had become of that man? He wished he
had a more accurate description of the man who had
entered the barroom of the Red Dragon Inn after
Lawrence.</p>

<p>“That man may know nothing,” he muttered as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
thought about him, “but, nevertheless, I should like
to find him.</p>

<p>“Who is he?</p>

<p>“What was he doing in the inn?</p>

<p>“Did he simply step in to get a drink, or did he
follow Lawrence in?</p>

<p>“I’m puzzled.”</p>

<p>The detective arose from his chair and commenced
to pace back and forth across the room.</p>

<p>All the time he puffed away vigorously on his cigar
and blew the smoke out in a long stream. Whenever
he was annoyed about anything he always smoked in
this way. He was so deep in thought that he did not
hear a knock on the door until the person without had
knocked several times.</p>

<p>Carter halted in the center of the room and called
out:</p>

<p>“Come in.”</p>

<p>The door was opened by Nick’s butler and Peter
Wright entered the room.</p>

<p>At a glance the detective saw he was excited.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you are in, Mr. Carter,” Wright ejaculated,
as he sank down in a chair.</p>

<p>He was puffing and blowing from exertion, and it
was several minutes before he became composed. He
mopped his brow with a large red bandanna and laid
his hat down on the floor by the side of his chair.</p>

<p>“It was a peculiar experience,” he ejaculated, looking
at the detective, “very peculiar—very peculiar——”</p>

<p>Mr. Wright had a rapid way of speaking when he
was excited, and he had a habit of repeating certain
words and phrases to emphasize what he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“It was deucedly peculiar,” he repeated, after a
slight pause.</p>

<p>Carter could not help smiling as he said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Wright, you forget that I know nothing about
it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so—confound it! I am so excited I can
hardly collect my thoughts. But it was a deucedly
peculiar experience, all the same,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>“Tell you all about it? So I will—yes—yes. Peculiar—it
was very peculiar——”</p>

<p>“No doubt. Try and collect your thoughts.”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wright mopped his brow for the twentieth
time, blew his nose, and then, rolling his bandanna
up into a ball, threw it into his hat, saying, as he
rested his elbows upon the arms of the chair and
leaned forward:</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter, I think I have important information
for you.”</p>

<p>“That is what I want,” the detective replied.</p>

<p>Nick was perfectly calm.</p>

<p>Not a muscle of his face moved.</p>

<p>But those shrewd eyes of his sparkled like two
gems.</p>

<p>“It was this way,” Mr. Wright continued, after a
momentary silence: “After you left me I returned
to my room in the hotel and sat down to glance at
the morning newspaper. I could not remain quiet for
any length of time, because my mind was dwelling
continuously on the murder.</p>

<p>“Well, an hour passed. I was pacing up and down
the room trying to recall to my mind everything I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
had known and had heard about Lawrence, when there
came a knock at my door.</p>

<p>“I called out for the party to come in, and a tall,
handsome, stylishly dressed woman entered the room.</p>

<p>“I was taken by surprise and was slightly confused.
I thought at first the woman had mistaken my room
for some one else’s. But she looked at me very calmly,
and when I did not speak she said:</p>

<p>“‘Are you not Mr. Wright?’</p>

<p>“Instantly I pulled myself together and acknowledged
that I was the individual. I invited her to be
seated.</p>

<p>“As far as I could remember, Mr. Carter, I had
never seen the woman before in all my life.</p>

<p>“‘You are Mr. Peter Wright?’ she asked again, as
soon as she was seated, and she placed considerable
emphasis upon ‘Peter,’ looking me straight in the eyes
with such intensity as if she were endeavoring to read
my most secret thoughts.</p>

<p>“‘My name is Peter Wright,’ I said, and I commenced
to experience a creeping sensation all over
me.</p>

<p>“Never before had I been in such a position.</p>

<p>“It may have been my imagination, but I thought
that she was making an effort to exert some influence
over me.</p>

<p>“Well, that is neither here nor there. It is a waste
of time for me to go into details about my feelings——”</p>

<p>“Go on,” Carter interrupted, “tell your story your
own way, and do not make any attempt to abridge it.
I am deeply interested.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“Let me see—oh, yes. As I said, I thought she was
trying to hypnotize me.</p>

<p>“As soon as I said that I was Peter Wright she
asked:</p>

<p>“‘Were you the owner of the Red Dragon Inn at
one time?’</p>

<p>“I replied in the affirmative, and I saw a smile
encircle her lips.</p>

<p>“‘You don’t remember me,’ she said, after a pause.</p>

<p>“‘Indeed, I do not,’ I replied. ‘I cannot recall that
I ever saw you before.’</p>

<p>“‘No doubt, no doubt,’ she murmured. She glanced
around the room and ran her hand across her forehead.
‘I have changed wonderfully,’ she went on.
‘Twenty years works wonderful changes in all of us,’
and she smiled, with the sweetest smile I ever beheld
upon the face of a woman.</p>

<p>“‘We all change,’ I interpolated, and she replied:</p>

<p>“‘You are right. I was a girl when you saw me last,
and now I am a woman. Mr. Wright, do you not
remember Isabella Porter?’</p>

<p>“The instant she mentioned the name I remembered
her.</p>

<p>“Her parents used to live a few doors from the Red
Dragon Inn. Her father was a produce merchant.
When she was a small girl I used to give her pennies
to spend. Her father died and her mother moved out
of the neighborhood. I lost track of them, and I had
not seen nor heard of Isabella until she appeared in
my room.</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, Mr. Carter, even after she
had told me who she was, I studied her face, but could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
not see a line in it that was familiar to me. I believed
she was Isabella Porter, all the same.</p>

<p>“I told her that I remembered her name, and then
for a time she was silent. She bowed her head, and
seemed lost in deep thought.</p>

<p>“Suddenly she glanced up at me.</p>

<p>“‘I’ve called to see you on a peculiar errand,’ she
informed me.</p>

<p>“‘What is it?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘One night about ten or eleven years ago,’ she
said, ‘a man called on you at the Red Dragon Inn and
gave you a package to keep.</p>

<p>“‘The man was a stranger to you.</p>

<p>“‘On the package was written the name of Edward
Peters.</p>

<p>“‘You put the package in your safe and the man
never called for it.’</p>

<p>“She paused and fastened her eyes upon me, Mr.
Carter, with that strange, uncanny, searching look—it
was certainly peculiar, <i>very</i> peculiar!</p>

<p>“I recalled the incident distinctly, but something
within me seemed to tell me to pretend ignorance about
the package, to try and draw her out and find out
what she was aiming at, so I said:</p>

<p>“‘I don’t remember any such incident.’</p>

<p>“Isabella Porter started and her face darkened.</p>

<p>“‘You don’t?’ she ejaculated, in a tone of annoyance.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ I replied. I was perfectly calm now, you
see, and I had full command of my senses.</p>

<p>“Isabella eyed me closely, but I returned her gaze
unflinchingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“Why I acted in this way I cannot tell. An unseen
force seemed to be guiding me.</p>

<p>“‘What did you do with the contents of your safe?’
Isabella asked.</p>

<p>“‘When I sold the place,’ I replied, ‘I removed the
contents of the safe. I placed the paper in a box and
locked it up in the safe deposit vault. Since that time
I have never looked at it,’ which was the truth.</p>

<p>“‘Then the package must be in your box,’ Isabella
ejaculated, and her countenance brightened. ‘Mr.
Wright, I want that package.’</p>

<p>“‘If it should be among my papers,’ I replied, ‘I
can’t see why I should deliver it to you. It does not
belong to you.’</p>

<p>“She bit her lips with annoyance and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“‘I must get possession of that package, Mr.
Wright.’</p>

<p>“‘Why?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘I can’t tell you the reason why,’ she answered.
‘You would not understand if I were able to explain.
But, Mr. Wright, please let me have that package.’</p>

<p>“‘What is in it?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘I can’t tell you,’ she replied.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, well,’ I said, with a false laugh. ‘It is nothing
to me. To-morrow I will hunt through my papers at
the safe deposit company and I will see if the package
is among them.’</p>

<p>“‘Can’t you look to-day?’ she asked, with great eagerness.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ I replied; ‘to-day is a holiday and the vault
is closed.’</p>

<p>“‘Then I suppose I must wait. What time shall I
call upon you to-morrow?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“‘About eleven o’clock,’ I answered.</p>

<p>“‘I will be here on time,’ she said, and she arose
from her chair.</p>

<p>“‘Where are you living?’ I inquired.</p>

<p>“‘At No. — West Nineteenth Street,’ she replied.</p>

<p>“‘With your mother?’</p>

<p>“‘My mother has been dead five years. I reside
in a flat alone.’</p>

<p>“‘Are you married?’</p>

<p>“‘No, no,’ she laughed.</p>

<p>“I wanted to question her further, but I refrained.</p>

<p>“Isabella departed.</p>

<p>“As soon as she was out of the room I locked the
door.</p>

<p>“I had lied to her, Mr. Carter. The box with the
contents of my old safe in it was not in the vault of
the safe deposit company, but it was resting under
my bed.</p>

<p>“I pulled it out into the center of the room and unlocked
it. I examined the contents, and at last came
across the package with the name of Edward Peters
written across the face.</p>

<p>“It was sealed.</p>

<p>“I broke the seals and tore off the wrapper.</p>

<p>“Another wrapper was beneath, and upon it was
writing.</p>

<p>“I read the indorsement.</p>

<p>“As the words appeared before my eyes I was so
overcome with excitement that I could not move or
think for some time.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wright paused, looked at Carter, put his hand
into the breast pocket of his coat, and pulled out a
large package.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>AN IMPORTANT PACKAGE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“This is the package,” Mr. Wright ejaculated, as
he held up the bundle. “I have not opened it.”</p>

<p>“What is the indorsement?” Carter asked.</p>

<p>“Listen and I will read.”</p>

<p>“Read.”</p>

<p>“‘Papers relating to the Lawrence will case.’”</p>

<p>“The deuce you say!”</p>

<p>“Read for yourself.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wright handed the package to the detective.</p>

<p>Carter took hold of it and read the indorsement.</p>

<p>“The writing is bold and clear,” he said. “No name
signed to it.”</p>

<p>“It is peculiar,” Mr. Wright rejoined. “It seems
strange that this should turn up just at this time, and
it is remarkable that I should have been impelled to
act as I did.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Carter remarked, and he became thoughtful,
while he held the package in his hand and gazed at it
fixedly.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose those papers contain?”</p>

<p>“We will examine them.”</p>

<p>“Why was Isabella Porter so anxious to get possession
of them?”</p>

<p>“That we will have to find out.”</p>

<p>“Who was Edward Peters?”</p>

<p>“I can’t answer the question.”</p>

<p>Carter laughed as he glanced at Mr. Wright, who
joined him, remarking:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“If I were not so excited I would never have asked
such a question, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that.”</p>

<p>“Let us examine those papers. There may be something
in them which will furnish you with a clew.”</p>

<p>“Or they may deepen the mystery.”</p>

<p>Carter broke the seals and tore off the wrapper.</p>

<p>Five documents fell into his lap.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright drew up his chair close to the detective’s
side.</p>

<p>Carter picked up one of the papers and read the
indorsement:</p>

<p>“‘Confession of George Blanchard, butler, employed
by Alfred Lawrence, Esq.’”</p>

<p>“Phew!” Mr. Wright gave a prolonged whistle.</p>

<p>His and the detective’s eyes met.</p>

<p>For some time they did not speak.</p>

<p>“Confession of George Blanchard,” repeated Mr.
Wright.</p>

<p>“We will read it,” the detective remarked, and he
opened the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>Carter cleared his throat and commenced to read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘I, George Blanchard, knowing that I am about to
die and to be called upon to face my Maker, desiring
to make reparation for grievous wrongs and sins which
I have committed, do make the following confession,
hoping thereby to ease my conscience. May God have
mercy upon my soul!</p>

<p>“‘I was born in Manchester, England, and at the
age of twenty I came to America.</p>

<p>“‘Shortly after my arrival in New York I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
engaged by Alfred Lawrence, Esq., to act as his butler,
and I went to work at his house, No. — Beach Street.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Lawrence was engaged in business with his
uncle, after whom he was named.</p>

<p>“‘Old Mr. Lawrence died, and when the will was
read it was found that his nephew was left all of the
property.</p>

<p>“‘Simeon Rich, another nephew of the deceased,
proceeded to contest the will, and he claimed that Mr.
Alfred Lawrence had forged the document.</p>

<p>“‘Previous to the death of old Mr. Lawrence, Mr.
Alfred Lawrence and his wife became estranged.</p>

<p>“‘They used to quarrel frequently.</p>

<p>“‘Mrs. Lawrence was a cold, willful, and heartless
woman.</p>

<p>“‘One day I discovered that she was meeting Simeon
Rich clandestinely. This was before the death of her
husband’s uncle.</p>

<p>“‘I saw that I had her in my power, and I made a
demand upon her for hush money, which she gave
to me.</p>

<p>“‘I threatened her with exposure, and I received
from her several hundred dollars.</p>

<p>“‘One night shortly after the death of old Mr.
Lawrence, Simeon Rich came to me and told me that
he was going to contest the will. He said he would
pay me ten thousand dollars if I would swear that I
had seen Mr. Alfred Lawrence forge the will.</p>

<p>“‘Mrs. Lawrence, he told me, would be on his side.</p>

<p>“‘He paid me one thousand dollars down, and the
balance he promised to give me as soon as the will was
broken.</p>

<p>“‘I entered into the plot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“‘Papers which would have cleared Mr. Alfred
Lawrence of the charge of forgery I stole from his
safe.</p>

<p>“‘These papers I have always kept in my possession,
and they will be found with this confession.</p>

<p>“‘One of the papers was a statement of the lawyer
who had drawn up the will and who had died just
before the contest.</p>

<p>“‘From time to time Simeon Rich has tried to get
possession of these papers, but I would never give
them to him.</p>

<p>“‘Another paper was a letter written by Mrs. Lawrence
to Rich, in which she outlined the whole plot.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Alfred Lawrence in some way got hold of
this letter.</p>

<p>“‘He was sent to State’s prison a year ago to-day.</p>

<p>“‘Mrs. Lawrence and Rich have gone abroad together.</p>

<p>“‘Two weeks ago, while crossing Broadway, I was
knocked down by a runaway team and taken to this
hospital.</p>

<p>“‘I have suffered terrible agony, and the doctors
have informed me that I cannot live.</p>

<p>“‘I intrust this confession and the stolen documents,
which will clear Mr. Alfred Lawrence, to my chum,
Edward Peters, with instructions to deliver them to
the proper authorities.</p>

<p>“‘(Signed)<span class="floatright"><span class="smcap">George Blanchard</span>.</span><br />

<p>“‘Dated August 17, 19—’”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>For some time after Carter finished reading he and
Mr. Wright sat in silence.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“That confession shows that Lawrence was innocent,”
he remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the detective rejoined, “but it throws no
light on the murder.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what became of Edward Peters and what
induced him to leave the package of documents with
me? If I had only known the value of those papers
years ago, I would have had Lawrence out of Sing
Sing in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if Doctor Leonard Thompson, whose
signature is attached to this confession, is the famous
specialist who now resides on upper Fifth Avenue?”</p>

<p>“We can easily find out by calling on him.”</p>

<p>“We will start for his house immediately.”</p>

<p>Carter put the papers into the inside pocket of his
coat, and then he and Mr. Wright started for the
house of the Fifth Avenue physician.</p>

<p>When the detective and his companion arrived at
the palatial mansion they were shown into a small
reception room in which a number of patients were
seated.</p>

<p>Carter gave his card to the butler, requesting him
to present it to his master and state that he desired
to see the doctor on important business.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the butler returned and said that
the doctor would see them.</p>

<p>Doctor Thompson was a man of fine physique and
aristocratic bearing.</p>

<p>At first he acted rather coldly when the detective
and Mr. Wright entered his private office. However,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
he invited them to be seated and asked what they
desired.</p>

<p>“Were you ever house physician at Bellevue Hospital?”
Carter inquired.</p>

<p>“I was,” Doctor Thompson replied.</p>

<p>“Is this your signature?”</p>

<p>The detective took the Blanchard confession out of
his pocket and showed the doctor the signature.</p>

<p>“This is my signature,” the physician said, after
he had glanced at it, and instantly he thawed out and
became interested. “What is that paper?”</p>

<p>“A confession of a man named George Blanchard,”
the detective answered. “He was at one time a butler
for a Mr. Alfred Lawrence.”</p>

<p>“I remember the man. He died from injuries received
in a runaway. I never knew what the confession
related to.</p>

<p>“A man named Peters was with him all the afternoon
before he died. I came up to the cot just as
he signed the paper, and Peters requested me to witness
the signature, which I did.</p>

<p>“My mind was busy with other matters, and I never
thought to ask what was in the paper.</p>

<p>“I signed the death certificate, and, if my memory
does not play me false, I think Peters claimed the
body and buried it.</p>

<p>“A month later Peters was brought to the hospital
in a dying condition. He had been stabbed, I think,
in some dark street downtown.</p>

<p>“I recognized him as the man who had been with
Blanchard and who had requested me to sign the
paper.</p>

<p>“He died without recovering consciousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“I can’t tell whether any one claimed his body or
not.”</p>

<p>“The records at Bellevue will show that?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Doctor, we are greatly obliged to you for this information.”</p>

<p>“Why are you so anxious——”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you anything just at present——”</p>

<p>“I understand, Mr. Carter. Well, if I can be of any
further service to you, don’t hesitate to call on me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Carter and Wright departed.</p>

<p>As soon as they were outside in the street, the latter
turned to the former and said:</p>

<p>“What are you going to do next?”</p>

<p>“We will go over to Bellevue,” the detective rejoined.</p>

<p>At the hospital Carter proceeded to examine the
record of deaths.</p>

<p>After a long search, he found the name of Edward
Peters.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” he said, turning to Peter Wright and
holding his finger on the name.</p>

<p>“Read what the record says,” said Wright.</p>

<p>“‘Peters, Edward. Forty, unmarried, native of
England. Cause of death: stab wound in back, over
left lobe of heart. Occupation: butler. Where employed:
No. — Fifth Avenue. Name of employer:
Mrs. Isabella Porter. Body claimed by Mrs. Porter.
Date, September 21.’”</p>

<p>“Well!” Wright ejaculated, and he looked at Carter,
with a quizzical expression upon his face.</p>

<p>“More mystery,” the detective rejoined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“Peters stopped at the Red Dragon Inn on the night
of September 20.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>“I put the date on the wrapper of the package.”</p>

<p>“Did you leave that wrapper in your room?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“From this record, it appears that the man was
Mrs. Porter’s butler.”</p>

<p>“Yes. She never had a butler when they lived on
West Broadway, and I was not aware that she had
gone to reside on Fifth Avenue.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Porter’s daughter was named after her?”</p>

<p>“Obviously!”</p>

<p>“Let us go to your hotel. When Miss Isabella
Porter calls on you to-morrow, tell her that you could
not find the package.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know how she learned about it.”</p>

<p>“That we will find out all in good time.”</p>

<p>“I will put these papers away in a safe place.”</p>

<p>“Do so.”</p>

<p>It was quite late when the detective and Wright
reached the hotel.</p>

<p>Carter recovered the wrapper which had been outside
of the package. He sealed the documents up in
an envelope, and had the bundle locked up in the hotel
safe.</p>

<p>When he reached his house, an hour later, he did not
retire to rest.</p>

<p>As soon as he locked the door of his sanctum, he
proceeded to change his clothing.</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour he had changed his appearance
so completely that his most intimate acquaintance
could not have recognized him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>What did he intend to do?</p>

<p>From the manner in which he acted, it was quite
clear that he did not propose to remain in. He examined
his notebook before leaving the room, and as
he went out he muttered:</p>

<p>“We will see what kind of place Miss Porter lives
in.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>THE THREAT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Carter desired to learn something about Isabella
Porter.</p>

<p>Her appearance at this time and her anxiety to
secure the papers which had been left in Mr. Wright’s
possession so many years before seemed peculiar.</p>

<p>As the detective reviewed the incidents, and recalled
the record of Peters’ death to his mind, he was almost
certain that the man had been attacked by some one
who desired to put him out of the way.</p>

<p>Was Peters’ death planned because he had in his
possession these damaging papers?</p>

<p>Carter pondered over this question.</p>

<p>The circumstance was puzzling.</p>

<p>Why was no attempt ever made until now to get
possession of the documents?</p>

<p>How did Isabella Porter come to know or suppose
that they were in the possession of Mr. Wright?</p>

<p>Was it any wonder that Carter was in a quandary
when these questions were presented to his mind?</p>

<p>He did not know what to think.</p>

<p>He was in the dark.</p>

<p>There was a veil before his eyes, figuratively speaking.</p>

<p>He felt that Isabella Porter had some connection
with the mystery of the Red Dragon Inn, but what
this connection was he could not determine.</p>

<p>Presently he arrived at the address on West Nineteenth
Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>It was an apartment house. He went into the vestibule
and examined the names on the letter boxes.</p>

<p>The name of the woman was not among them.</p>

<p>“It is as I supposed,” the detective muttered, “she
does not live here, and she gave Mr. Wright this
address simply as a blind.”</p>

<p>To make sure that he was not wrong in his surmise,
Carter called on the janitor and questioned him.</p>

<p>The man did not know any woman by the name of
Isabella Porter, and he was sure that no woman answering
to her description lived in the house.</p>

<p>“She had some deep object in view when she gave
that false address,” the detective thought. “The discovery
alone is sufficient to make one suspect her.”</p>

<p>Early the next morning the detective called at the
address on Fifth Avenue which he had found in the
record of Peters’ death.</p>

<p>No one knew anything about any person by the
name of Porter.</p>

<p>He returned to the hotel, and went to Mr. Wright’s
room, intending to remain there until the woman
called.</p>

<p>He sent a message to the cashier of the safe deposit
company, stating that he had important business on
hand, and he would see him later in the day.</p>

<p>Noon arrived, and Isabella Porter did not appear.</p>

<p>Carter was impatient.</p>

<p>“I’ve wasted the whole morning,” he remarked to
Wright.</p>

<p>“That woman promised to call early,” Wright rejoined.
“Do you think her suspicions were aroused?”</p>

<p>“That I cannot tell.”</p>

<p>“It is curious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“Very.”</p>

<p>Carter strode over to the window and looked out
into the street. He was in a brown study.</p>

<p>What should he do?</p>

<p>Just then some one knocked on the door, and the
detective opened it.</p>

<p>A messenger boy stood before him.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a note for Mr. Peter Wright,” the boy
said.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright took the note, and opened it. He
glanced at it, and then turning to the boy, asked:</p>

<p>“From whom did you receive this?”</p>

<p>“A man,” the boy replied.</p>

<p>“Where was he when he gave it to you?”</p>

<p>“In the barroom of the Humberland House.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a looking man was he?”</p>

<p>“He was tall, had a smooth face and black hair.”</p>

<p>“What did he say when he gave you the note?”</p>

<p>“He said simply to fetch it down to you.”</p>

<p>“Was that all?”</p>

<p>“That was all.”</p>

<p>“Did he pay you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You may go.”</p>

<p>“Wait, sonny.”</p>

<p>It was Carter who spoke. He had remained quiet
during the time Peter Wright was questioning the lad.</p>

<p>“Let me see that note?” he asked, and Wright
handed the message to him. He read it, and a smile
crossed his face.</p>

<p>Then he looked at the boy, and asked:</p>

<p>“Did you ever see the man before?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“No, sir,” the boy answered.</p>

<p>“You may go.”</p>

<p>When the messenger was out of the room, Carter
turned to Mr. Wright, and said:</p>

<p>“This note shows that the woman suspected a trap.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” Mr. Wright rejoined. “Read the note
to me. I just glanced at it.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“‘<i>Mr. Peter Wright.</i></p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: I cannot call on you to-day. I thought
you were a gentleman, but I have discovered that I
cannot trust you. After I left you yesterday I learned
that you held a conference with Nicholas Carter, the
detective, and he commenced to make inquiries about
me. That man had better beware of how he meddles
with my affairs. I know that you have that package
in your possession, and if you turn it over to that detective,
you will live to regret it. Yours very respectfully,</p>

<p class="right">“‘<span class="smcap">Isabella Porter.</span>’”</p>
</div>

<p>“Humph!” Mr. Wright ejaculated, when the detective
finished reading. “<i>That</i> for her threat!” and the
old man snapped his fingers together, while defiance
shone in his eyes.</p>

<p>“One thing is certain,” Carter remarked.</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“We’re watched.”</p>

<p>“By whom?”</p>

<p>“Probably by the man who gave the note to the
messenger boy.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I am going to call on the cashier of the safe deposit
company.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later the detective was in the office of
the safe deposit company. He and the cashier visited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
the vault, and, after some hesitation, the latter opened
Lawrence’s box.</p>

<p>It was empty.</p>

<p>When this discovery was made, Carter uttered an
exclamation of chagrin.</p>

<p>“Who could have removed the contents?” the cashier
ejaculated. “Lawrence told me positively that he had
valuable papers in this box.”</p>

<p>“They have been removed, but whether recently; or
years ago, we cannot tell,” the detective said.</p>

<p>“It is annoying.”</p>

<p>Carter left the vault and started uptown.</p>

<p>So far, he considered that he had made very little
progress with the investigation.</p>

<p>He reached the Humberland House, and entered
the café.</p>

<p>It was four o’clock in the afternoon, and quite a
number of men were in the place. He thought that
there might be a chance of learning something here,
and that was the reason why he had stopped.</p>

<p>The man who had given Isabella Porter’s note to
the messenger he thought might come into the place.
He sat down at one of the tables, and proceeded to
inspect the men around him.</p>

<p>His attention was attracted toward a tall man who
was seated at the next table, with a short, stout man.</p>

<p>The man was well dressed.</p>

<p>There was something about his manner the detective
did not like, and he looked at him more closely than
he otherwise would have done.</p>

<p>All of a sudden it came to him that this man answered
the description of the man who had given the
messenger boy Isabella Porter’s note.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Carter acted cautiously, so that the man would not
notice that he was watching him.</p>

<p>They spoke in low tones, and it was some time before
the detective was able to catch a word they said.</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair and listened.</p>

<p>The men were drinking.</p>

<p>After a time they commenced to talk louder, and
the detective was able to hear.</p>

<p>A man of less experience would have started, and
perhaps betrayed himself when he heard the stout
man address his companion as Rich.</p>

<p>Not so Carter. He did not move in his chair, or
show any sign that he had heard a word.</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed on a painting on the opposite
wall, and apparently he was examining it.</p>

<p>“Well, Rich,” the detective heard the stout man
ejaculate, “I think you made a mistake.”</p>

<p>For a while this was all he heard, for the man
spoke in low tones again.</p>

<p>But this was sufficient to make Carter more deeply
interested in those two men.</p>

<p>“Can this be Simeon Rich who conspired against
Lawrence?” he asked himself.</p>

<p>There was a chance that the man was in no way
related to the murdered man.</p>

<p>After a time the detective heard the man Rich remark:</p>

<p>“Isabella made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” the stout man rejoined,
and at the same time he lighted a fresh cigar, while
he leaned back in his chair and blew the smoke up
in the air over his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“Darwin,” replied Rich, in a low, clear, deep voice,
“I think you are unnecessarily alarmed.”</p>

<p>“I am not. I have heard a great deal of that man’s
ability.”</p>

<p>“All such men are overestimated. When they are
brought face to face with shrewd men they fail.”</p>

<p>“Make no mistake. That man has circumvented
shrewder men than we.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!”</p>

<p>“Even at this moment he may be in possession of
important evidence.”</p>

<p>“How could he secure it?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, and yet I do not feel safe.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, we have nothing to fear.”</p>

<p>“You should never have had that letter of Isabella’s
delivered.”</p>

<p>“The old fool will never dare to show it.”</p>

<p>“That man has already been to Bellevue and examined
the records.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>“I made inquiries.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“This afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Humph!”</p>

<p>“It was well I had him watched.”</p>

<p>“In one way it was.”</p>

<p>“Yes, in many ways.”</p>

<p>The men rested back in their chairs, and were silent.</p>

<p>Carter had heard every word, and he was sure that
the two men had referred to him, although they had
not mentioned any names.</p>

<p>His heart beat violently, in spite of his stoicism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>Outwardly he was composed, but inwardly he was
excited.</p>

<p>“Am I on the right trail at last?” he asked himself.</p>

<p>“Have these men had anything to do with the
mysterious murder at the Red Dragon Inn? Ought
I to suspect them?”</p>

<p>Darwin arose from the table, paid the cashier for
what they had had, and then the two men strolled out
of the café into the corridor of the hotel, when they
halted near the newspaper stand.</p>

<p>Carter followed them openly but unobtrusively, and
stood within a few feet of them.</p>

<p>The lobby was crowded with people, and it was easy
to keep them under surveillance without the fear of
attracting their attention.</p>

<p>“Well, Rich, what are you going to do?” Carter
heard Darwin ask, after they had stood silent for
some time near the door.</p>

<p>“I am going uptown,” Rich replied evasively.</p>

<p>“To see Isabella?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Try and induce her to take a trip to Philadelphia,
and remain there until things quiet down.”</p>

<p>“She won’t listen to that.”</p>

<p>“Confound these women, anyway! If you had let
me manage that affair, and kept her out of it, there
would have been nothing to worry about. As it is,
you went ahead without asking my advice, and the
result may be that you have furnished that man with
a clew which will lead up to our downfall.”</p>

<p>“Always croaking, Dick!”</p>

<p>“No, I am not.”</p>

<p>“What are <i>you</i> going to do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“I am going to take a trip down to Lem Samson’s
joint, and see if Brockey Gann has any report to
make.”</p>

<p>“What time to-morrow will you meet me?”</p>

<p>“Eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Here,” said Darwin.</p>

<p>“If anything of importance has occurred, I will
send you word.”</p>

<p>“Then, good night.”</p>

<p>They had walked out into the street, and now they
separated, one starting uptown and the other walking
down to the corner of Twenty-fourth Street, where
he halted to wait for a car.</p>

<p>For a moment or so Carter was in doubt about which
one he ought to follow.</p>

<p>Richard Darwin had mentioned that he was going
downtown to a place kept by a man named Lem Samson.</p>

<p>The detective was familiar with the place, which was
one of the worst crooks’ resorts on Houston Street,
near Macdougal Street.</p>

<p>He also knew that Brockey Gann was the leader
of a gang of thugs.</p>

<p>He had arrested Brockey several times, and once he
succeeded in sending him to State’s prison for a short
term.</p>

<p>Carter saw Darwin start out toward the center of
the street as a downtown car came along.</p>

<p>In an instant his mind was made up.</p>

<p>He ran out into the street and jumped aboard the
car ahead of Darwin.</p>

<p>On the way downtown the detective made a close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
study of the man. He did not remember that he had
ever seen him before.</p>

<p>Darwin had the appearance of a man in prosperous
circumstances.</p>

<p>That he had been in the habit of associating with
sporting men was quite evident from certain phrases
which Carter had heard him utter.</p>

<p>At Houston Street Darwin jumped off the car.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>EAVESDROPPING.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Carter did not act hastily. He waited until Darwin
had turned the corner before he alighted from the
car. Then he started after his quarry, whom he soon
caught sight of hurrying along on the south side of
Houston Street.</p>

<p>The detective kept on the north side of the street.</p>

<p>As he walked along, he made a few changes in his
disguise, so that if he and Darwin were brought face
to face again the man would not recognize him as the
same person who had stood on the platform of the
car with him.</p>

<p>Darwin entered the crooks’ resort.</p>

<p>Carter followed him inside.</p>

<p>A number of men were leaning up against the bar.</p>

<p>Lem Samson, a tall, burly, broad-shouldered, red-faced
man, with an ugly scar over his left temple, was
serving out the drinks.</p>

<p>Darwin stepped up to the bar and spoke to Samson.</p>

<p>Carter got near them, and heard what was said.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Brockey?” Darwin asked.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t been in this evening,” Samson replied.
“Did you expect to meet him to-night?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Go into the back room and wait.”</p>

<p>“Is any one in there?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Carter sat down in a chair near the door of that
room, and feigned intoxication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>No one paid any attention to him.</p>

<p>The minutes passed.</p>

<p>Then the door of the room opened, and a man entered.
He was dressed in black. His coat was tightly
buttoned up, so as nearly to hide the white handkerchief
that encompassed his scrawny throat. His hair—and
it was not very luxuriant—was of a foxy color,
and combed straight down, giving the observer the
idea that it had been operated on by the prison barber.
Pitted pockmarks covered his colorless, lean face.</p>

<p>At a glance the detective recognized Brockey Gann.</p>

<p>The rascal cast his restless eyes around the room, as
if he were in fear of some danger, and, thus shuffling
up to the bar, he asked of Samson, in a hoarse tone
of voice:</p>

<p>“Have you seen him?”</p>

<p>“He’s waiting inside,” Samson replied, pointing toward
the back room with his thumb.</p>

<p>Brockey, as he passed Carter, looked at him.</p>

<p>The detective’s head was bending forward, and,
apparently, he was asleep.</p>

<p>“Jaggy,” Brockey muttered as he passed into the
room.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you have come at last, Brockey,” the detective
heard Darwin exclaim. “Sit down. Help yourself
to the rosy.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Brockey replied, and he seated himself
at the table, pouring out a glassful of liquor and
swallowing it at a gulp.</p>

<p>Darwin handed him a cigar, which he lighted and
proceeded to smoke.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“What did you discover this afternoon?” Darwin
asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>“Nothing much.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what you did learn.”</p>

<p>“Well, the cove left the hotel and went downtown
to the Manhattan Safe Deposit Company.</p>

<p>“Then he returned to the house.</p>

<p>“I laid around the place for several hours, thinking
he would come out. He did not put in an appearance,
and I proceeded to make inquiries.</p>

<p>“Then I discovered that he was not in his room, and
I knew he had left the hotel.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been able to get on his trail.”</p>

<p>“The deuce!”</p>

<p>“That cove is like an eel.”</p>

<p>For a time the men were silent.</p>

<p>Carter realized that Brockey had been tracking him,
and saw that in the future he would have to be more
cautious.</p>

<p>It was only by a mere stroke of good luck that he
had slipped out of the hotel unrecognized.</p>

<p>Finally, Darwin looked across the table at his companion,
and said:</p>

<p>“I think I can trust you, Brockey.”</p>

<p>“Think you can!” Brockey ejaculated. “You have
done so, and never found me unworthy of the trust.
You remember——”</p>

<p>The blood left Darwin’s face when thus addressed,
for a moment, and a paleness usurped its place.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Darwin, I was in hopes——”</p>

<p>“I think you are misunderstanding me. I know you—I
can trust you, and it is not everybody I would;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
let that suffice. I shall want you to do something more
for me.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Carter must be put out of the way.”</p>

<p>“I begin to comprehend. That man has been the
bitterest enemy that I ever had.”</p>

<p>“You don’t love him?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then you will undertake the job?”</p>

<p>“For a consideration—yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t expect you to do it for nothing. I will
pay you liberally. But, remember, there must be no
failure.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p>“Your best!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said,” retorted Brockey.</p>

<p>“You must not fail.”</p>

<p>“There is a chance that I may.”</p>

<p>“You must not.”</p>

<p>“See here, Darwin, that cove is one of the worst
terrors in the business.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that——”</p>

<p>“Well—it——”</p>

<p>“Well——”</p>

<p>The men were sitting with their elbows leaning
upon the table, and they stared into each other’s eyes
for some time in silence.</p>

<p>“Say, Darwin,” Brockey finally blurted out, “I don’t
like to be spoken to in that way. You talk as if you
had a hold on me.”</p>

<p>“I <i>have</i> a hold on you!” Darwin fairly hissed, and
his face darkened, while his eyes shone like two coals
of fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“So you think. But I have also a hold on you, my
bully boy, and don’t you forget it!”</p>

<p>Again a silence fell on them.</p>

<p>Darwin scowled.</p>

<p>Brockey smiled, showing a hideous gold tooth.</p>

<p>“We won’t quarrel,” Darwin at last remarked.</p>

<p>“I guess not,” Brockey replied, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Will you do the work?”</p>

<p>“I told you I would.”</p>

<p>“Then start out to-night to run him down.”</p>

<p>“The exchequer is very low.”</p>

<p>“How much will you need?”</p>

<p>“Five hundred down and five thousand when the
cove is out of the way.”</p>

<p>“That is too much.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk in that way. You know it is not too
much. You and that other chap are going to pull out
a big stake.”</p>

<p>“I am no fool, Darwin.”</p>

<p>“One word from me, and——”</p>

<p>“Hush! We are in a public barroom, and you ought
to be more cautious.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to come to time?”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you three hundred to-night, and to-morrow
we will talk about the balance.”</p>

<p>“Fork out the three hundred.”</p>

<p>Darwin took a roll of bills out of his pocket, counted
out the amount, and passed it over to Brockey, who
smiled again and shoved the money into his trousers
pocket.</p>

<p>“How will you proceed?” Darwin asked.</p>

<p>“I’ll make up my mind later,” Brockey replied.</p>

<p>“To-morrow I shall expect to hear——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Don’t count on hearing to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I may not be able to find him to-night.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“I’ll meet you here to-morrow afternoon at four
o’clock. Are you going?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p>Darwin and Brockey left the room.</p>

<p>They passed the detective, and Darwin said:</p>

<p>“Did you notice that fellow?” pointing to Carter.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” Brockey answered. “He’s got a jag
on.”</p>

<p>They halted in the center of the room, and looked
back at the detective, who did not stir.</p>

<p>“Suppose he should be shamming?” Darwin remarked,
in an undertone.</p>

<p>“G’way,” Brockey retorted.</p>

<p>“He may have heard what we were talking about.”</p>

<p>“Not much.”</p>

<p>“I have a sort of feeling that he is a spy.”</p>

<p>Brockey gazed intently at Carter.</p>

<p>Without uttering a word, he strode across the room
and clutched hold of the detective by the shoulder,
shaking him vigorously.</p>

<p>“Wosh de ma-asher!” Carter growled, making no
attempt to resist. “Wosh de ma-asher,” he mumbled,
a second time, in a maudlin tone. “Lesh a fel’ alone.”</p>

<p>“Get up out of here!” Brockey exclaimed, and he
jerked the detective out of the chair.</p>

<p>Carter struggled from side to side, and his acting
was perfect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>No one in the place paid any attention to him and
Brockey except Darwin.</p>

<p>“Shay, ain’t chue a-goin’ t’ lea’ up?” Carter mumbled,
and he caught hold of Brockey by the arms, to
steady himself.</p>

<p>“Where do you live?” Brockey asked.</p>

<p>“Nowhere.”</p>

<p>The rascal was entirely deceived. He firmly believed
that the detective was nothing more than a
drunken “bum.” He let go his hold on him, and, with
a grunt of well-feigned disgust, Carter staggered out
of the den.</p>

<p>Brockey and Darwin followed.</p>

<p>The detective disappeared around the corner.</p>

<p>The instant he was out of sight he straightened up
and darted into the doorway of a house, where he
made a change in his disguise. He was anxious not
to lose sight of Darwin, and he hastened back around
into Houston Street again.</p>

<p>He almost ran into Brockey, who had separated
from Darwin, who was hurrying off up the street in
the direction of Broadway.</p>

<p>Brockey did not recognize the detective, and, with
an oath, he passed around the corner.</p>

<p>Carter started after Darwin. He reached Broadway
a few seconds later than he, and by a lucky chance
he was able to get on the same car with him.</p>

<p>Carter was sure that he had struck the right trail.
Indeed, he was firmly convinced now that Darwin and
Rich were implicated in the murder, that they had
formed together some dastardly plot.</p>

<p>The detective did not make any effort to surmise
what that plot was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>It was too early yet to start to theorize.</p>

<p>By the detective’s side on the platform of the car
Darwin stood, entirely unconscious that the man whom
he had paid Brockey to kill was near him.</p>

<p>When the car reached Thirty-first Street, Darwin
jumped off, lighted a cigar, and strolled leisurely down
the block, turning into Sixth Avenue.</p>

<p>Carter was not far behind him.</p>

<p>“I’m going to find out more about you, my lad,”
the detective thought, as he followed Darwin into a
crowded dance hall.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight, and the place was filled with
men and women. A band was playing a popular waltz,
and the floor was crowded with dancers. Loud laughter
and shouts of maudlin mirth were heard on all
sides.</p>

<p>Darwin halted near the entrance, and cast his eyes
over the dancers.</p>

<p>“He’s looking for some one,” Carter mentally commented,
as he noted his every action.</p>

<p>Darwin, at that moment, started up the stairway
leading to the gallery.</p>

<p>The detective followed close behind him.</p>

<p>In the gallery, ranged along the railing, were small
tables, at which merry parties of men about town and
tenderloiners were seated, drinking.</p>

<p>The women were flashily and expensively dressed,
and many of them were adorned with valuable
jewelry.</p>

<p>Darwin, as soon as he reached the gallery, looked
searchingly around.</p>

<p>Suddenly he started across the rear, and reached a
table at the opposite side of which a young woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
was sitting alone. The woman looked at him, and
nodded coldly as he drew up a chair beside her.</p>

<p>Carter had also crossed the gallery, and he stood
within a few feet of the table.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you, Dora?” asked Richard
Darwin, as he sat down and ordered a waiter to
fetch a bottle of champagne.</p>

<p>“You know well enough what is the matter,” Dora
snappishly replied. “What’s the use of you trying to
feign ignorance?”</p>

<p>“You look real sweet when you talk in that way.”</p>

<p>“How dare you!”</p>

<p>Dora’s fine eyes flashed. She turned around in her
chair, faced Darwin, and glared at him.</p>

<p>One could see that she was not in an amiable mood.
She was angry about something. Her face was
flushed, and she raised her hand, as if she would have
liked to have struck her companion in the face.</p>

<p>“Here’s the wine,” Darwin exclaimed, with a forced
laugh, as the waiter placed the bottle and glasses on
the table. “Drink some, and see if it won’t put you
in a good humor.”</p>

<p>“I want none of your wine,” Dora retorted. “Keep
it for your——”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do.”</p>

<p>“I won’t touch it. You and I are quits from this
night forth.”</p>

<p>“Phew!”</p>

<p>“Probably you think I don’t mean it?”</p>

<p>“You <i>don’t</i> mean it, my dear girl. Drink your
wine.”</p>

<p>“I want no wine that you have paid for. I want
nothing from a man who will deceive me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“I haven’t deceived you, Dora. Indeed, I haven’t.
I don’t understand what you mean.”</p>

<p>“You scoundrel!”</p>

<p>The conversation was carried on in low tones, but
it was exciting and intense.</p>

<p>Dora leaned back in her chair, as she called Darwin
a scoundrel, and she looked him squarely in the
eyes.</p>

<p>Carter, who had heard all that was said, was deeply
interested.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>A WOMAN SCORNED.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Dora kept her eyes fastened on Darwin.</p>

<p>There was a peculiar glitter in them.</p>

<p>At first Darwin returned her gaze without flinching,
but soon he commenced to move about uneasily.</p>

<p>For some time neither spoke.</p>

<p>A cynical smile played around the corners of Dora’s
lips.</p>

<p>“You are contemptible,” she sneered. “Really, I
should feel sorry for you if I did not despise you so
intensely!”</p>

<p>“Really, Dora, I don’t understand you,” Darwin
replied.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand me? How can you sit there
and say that? Where were you to-day at eleven
o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Why—I—I——”</p>

<p>“Don’t lie to me. Where were you?”</p>

<p>“I was in O’Rourke’s restaurant.”</p>

<p>“With whom?”</p>

<p>“Sally Rich.”</p>

<p>“What were you doing in her company?”</p>

<p>“I met her by chance.”</p>

<p>“You had an appointment with her.”</p>

<p>“I did not.”</p>

<p>“I was in O’Rourke’s at the time, and I saw both
of you.”</p>

<p>“Spying on me?”</p>

<p>Darwin’s face darkened, and he bit the ends of his
mustache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“I was <i>not</i> spying on you,” Dora ejaculated. “I
wouldn’t spy on any one. But I am glad I’ve discovered
your duplicity.”</p>

<p>“You are jealous of Sally Rich,” Darwin retorted.</p>

<p>“I am <i>not</i>! But I do hate her.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that. She hates <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“She is a low——”</p>

<p>“Hush!”</p>

<p>“I will not hush! This is the third time that I have
caught you with her.”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand. I have business with her
brother——”</p>

<p>“Do you expect me to believe that? Not much! I’m
not green. As long as you prefer that woman’s society
to mine, you may go with her, and I never want you
to speak to me again.”</p>

<p>“But, Dora——”</p>

<p>“Dick Darwin, my mind is made up.”</p>

<p>“Do listen to reason, Dora.”</p>

<p>“Good night.”</p>

<p>Dora arose from the table, cast a contemptuous
glance at Darwin, and walked into a side room.</p>

<p>“Confound that woman!” Darwin muttered, as he
gazed after her. “If she turns against me, she may
ruin me. I wish I hadn’t met Sally Rich—at least,
not for the present.”</p>

<p>Carter heard what Darwin muttered, and he saw
that the man was greatly disturbed.</p>

<p>“He’s afraid of Dora, for some reason,” the detective
cogitated. “If I could get her out of here,
unseen by Darwin, while she is in her present mood,
I might be able to worm some information out of her.
Shall I make the attempt?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>Carter looked into the next room, where he saw
Dora putting on her cloak. He glanced at Darwin,
who was leaning back in his chair in a brown study.</p>

<p>“Shall I try?” the detective thought, and he gazed
after Dora, who was starting for the stairway. He
saw that Darwin did not move, and he was still thinking.</p>

<p>In an instant his mind was made up, and he started
after Dora.</p>

<p>She went out into the street.</p>

<p>Then the detective spoke to her.</p>

<p>“You are a stranger to me,” she said coldly, with
an air of affronted dignity.</p>

<p>“I am not such a stranger as you think, Miss Ferris.
We have met several times,” Carter rejoined.</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to remember you.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, in this rig. Will you come up to
Sherton’s with me and have some supper? I want
to talk with you.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“My name is Nicholas Carter.”</p>

<p>“Why, I——”</p>

<p>“You need not be afraid.”</p>

<p>“I am not afraid.”</p>

<p>“Will you accompany me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“I will explain when we get to Sherton’s. There we
can secure a secluded table, and no one will see us.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that——”</p>

<p>“You will not regret it.”</p>

<p>“I will go with you.”</p>

<p>The detective and Dora had little to say until after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
the repast at Sherton’s was placed upon the table, and
they were alone.</p>

<p>“Now we can talk,” the detective said, as soon as
the waiter had left the room.</p>

<p>“You said you desired to secure some information
from me?” Dora remarked.</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine what it is about.”</p>

<p>“You have been friendly with a man named Dick
Darwin?”</p>

<p>Dora started. She laid down her knife and fork,
and looked at the detective, with amazement depicted
upon every line of her handsome face.</p>

<p>“You heard what passed between us a while ago?”
she ejaculated.</p>

<p>“I did,” Carter calmly replied, and he smiled.</p>

<p>“Then you know that I have thrown him over?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I do not intend to have anything more to do with
him.”</p>

<p>“Do you really mean that?”</p>

<p>“I do. I am serious. I have made many sacrifices
for that man, and he has treated me brutally.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow you will change your mind.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter, my mind is made up. Nothing will
make me change it. I possess my father’s nature.
You were a friend of his, and you know how bitter
he could be against any one for whom he formed a
dislike. It is the same way with me.”</p>

<p>“Then you will not hesitate to tell me all you know
about Darwin?”</p>

<p>“Has he committed a crime?” asked Dora.</p>

<p>“Do <i>you</i> think he has?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“I do not know.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” asserted Carter, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Then why are you so anxious to get information
about him?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>Dora gazed at the detective. She picked up the glass
of wine and commenced to sip the amber-colored
liquid.</p>

<p>Carter was silent, but he watched her closely.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter,” Dora said, as she set down the glass,
“I will tell you everything I know about that man.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” the detective rejoined.</p>

<p>“I hate him.”</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed. The hot blood mantled her brow,
and she hissed out the words between her clenched
teeth.</p>

<p>Now the detective saw that she was in earnest. He
knew that she did hate Dick Darwin, and no power
could make her become friendly with him again.</p>

<p>“How long have you been acquainted with him?”
Carter asked, after a short silence.</p>

<p>“About three years,” Dora answered.</p>

<p>“Where did you first meet him?”</p>

<p>“In London.”</p>

<p>“What were you doing over there?”</p>

<p>“I was in the chorus of ‘A Girl from New York.’
We were playing over there at the Gayety.”</p>

<p>“Were you introduced to him?”</p>

<p>“I was.”</p>

<p>“By whom?”</p>

<p>“One of the other chorus girls, Sally Rich.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“Then you were acquainted with Miss Rich?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And her brother?”</p>

<p>“I know him.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How long have you known him?”</p>

<p>“Four years.”</p>

<p>“Where did you first meet him?”</p>

<p>“At Koster &amp; Bial’s, where his sister and I were
singing together.”</p>

<p>“Tell me all you know about Darwin.”</p>

<p>“Give me time to collect my thoughts.”</p>

<p>“Take all the time you desire.”</p>

<p>Carter was succeeding better than he had calculated.</p>

<p>At first he did not suspect that Dora felt so bitterly
about the manner in which she had been treated by
Darwin. He congratulated himself on the move he
had made.</p>

<p>As he watched Dora, and noted the fleeting shadows
crossing her face, he was able to read almost all her
thoughts. He saw that she had no compunctions of
conscience, no tenderness for Darwin, and that she
would tell all she knew about the man.</p>

<p>Did she know anything about the mysterious murder
at the Red Dragon Inn?</p>

<p>The detective was unable to surmise.</p>

<p>Finally, Dora raised her eyes, and, gazing straight
at Carter, she said:</p>

<p>“Dick Darwin is a cousin of Simeon Rich. His
mother was a sister of Rich’s father. He was educated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
in England, and he resided there until he was thirty
years of age, when he came to New York to live.</p>

<p>“When his father died he inherited a small fortune.
He soon ran through it. Then he became connected
with several dramatic enterprises, and made money.</p>

<p>“Six months ago he took a company out on the
road, and he became stranded in Cincinnati.</p>

<p>“I sent him money to return to New York.</p>

<p>“When he got here he was broke.</p>

<p>“For some time he and Rich did not speak, but
after he got back to the city they patched up their
differences and became as thick as two peas in a pod.
Recently he got to going around with Sally Rich, unknown
to me, and when I found it out, and chided
him for it, he insulted me.</p>

<p>“Lately I have noticed that he was quite flush of
money. He would not let me know where he got
it from. When I would ask him what he was doing
he would fly into a towering rage.</p>

<p>“To-day when I saw him with Sally Rich I made
up my mind to sever our relationship.”</p>

<p>Dora stopped talking and drank some wine.</p>

<p>“You have not told me <i>all</i> you know about Darwin,”
Carter remarked.</p>

<p>“How do you know that I have not?”</p>

<p>“I can tell from the manner in which you spoke
that you have kept something back.”</p>

<p>“What do you think I have kept back?”</p>

<p>“Was Darwin ever guilty of any crime?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I want to know.”</p>

<p>“In England he was arrested for forgery.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“He was released on bail, and he fled to this
country.”</p>

<p>“What did he forge?”</p>

<p>“Checks.”</p>

<p>“Then he was never tried?”</p>

<p>“No. The charges are still pending against him.”</p>

<p>“Is Dick Darwin his right name?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Were you ever present when he and Rich were
together?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know what business they are engaged
in?”</p>

<p>“I do not. I wish I did know.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear Sally or her brother speak
of a man named Lawrence?”</p>

<p>“Sally Rich once told me that she had an uncle
by that name.”</p>

<p>“Did she ever speak about him?”</p>

<p>“She only said that he died and left her and her
brother a lot of money. They had to fight for it in
the courts.”</p>

<p>“Was that all she told you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Carter thought for some time before he asked another
question. He reviewed all that Dora had told
him. He had gained some important information, but
not as much as he had expected. However, he was
firmly convinced that Dora had told him the truth, and
that she had concealed nothing.</p>

<p>“Miss Ferris,” he said, after a time, “where was
Dick Darwin on New Year’s Eve?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“I don’t know where he was. He was with Rich.
That I do know.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“I saw them together, going down Sixth Avenue,
about nine o’clock at night. They did not see me.”</p>

<p>“What time did you next see him?”</p>

<p>“At two o’clock in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“He came to my flat. He was greatly excited about
something, and it seemed to me that he was very
nervous.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he say where he had been?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Did you ask him?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“And he would not tell you?”</p>

<p>“He would not.”</p>

<p>“You say he was very nervous?”</p>

<p>“Very. His clothing was spattered with mud, and
it seemed to me as if he had been in some kind of a
rumpus.”</p>

<p>“Was he intoxicated?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Is the clothing which he had on that night at your
flat?”</p>

<p>“It is in his room there. But, Mr. Carter, for what
purpose are you asking all these questions? What
do you suspect?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you now.”</p>

<p>“You can trust me. I hate Dick Darwin so that I
would help you to send him to prison.”</p>

<p>“Would you do that?”</p>

<p>“I swear I would do it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“I am afraid——”</p>

<p>“Afraid I wouldn’t?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Try me—trust me.”</p>

<p>Carter looked at the woman intently for some time
in silence.</p>

<p>Over and over again he asked himself whether he
dare to trust her or not, and, at the same time, he was
evolving a plan in his mind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>MORE EVIDENCE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Dora was the first to speak and break the silence.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter,” she said, “I can see that Rich and
Darwin are implicated in some affair which you are
investigating. It may be a crime. It was committed on
New Year’s Eve, or you would not be so particular
about that date. I feel sure of that.”</p>

<p>“You are a shrewd woman,” the detective remarked,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“I am not very shrewd, but I can read character, and
I am able to form conclusions by putting two and two
together.</p>

<p>“You asked about Dick Darwin’s clothing. If you
desire to examine it, I will take you to my flat, and
you can inspect it.”</p>

<p>“Darwin may be there now.”</p>

<p>“No, he is not. He can’t get in. I have the key.”</p>

<p>“I will go with you to your flat.”</p>

<p>“Tell me first what case you are working on.”</p>

<p>“That must remain a secret for the present.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! I know!”</p>

<p>“You know?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What case am I working on?”</p>

<p>“The mystery of the Red Dragon Inn.”</p>

<p>Dora laughed heartily.</p>

<p>Carter uttered an exclamation of annoyance.</p>

<p>“When you mentioned the name of Lawrence, I remembered
that a man by that name had been murdered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
on New Year’s Eve at the Red Dragon Inn, and I also
remembered that it was stated that you were working
on the case. You see, I know.”</p>

<p>“Humph!”</p>

<p>“Now that I come to think of it, I remember reading
that that man had just been released from State’s
prison. It was also stated that he was the forger of
the Lawrence will. If that be so, then he was a cousin
of Simeon and Sally Rich. Mr. Carter!”</p>

<p>“What is the matter?”</p>

<p>“A thought just occurred to me, and it startled me.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“Do you believe that Simeon Rich and Richard Darwin
had a hand in that murder?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Rich was afraid of Lawrence——”</p>

<p>“We will not talk any more about this matter. We
will start for your flat.”</p>

<p>“I will help you.”</p>

<p>“I believe you.”</p>

<p>They arose from the table.</p>

<p>Carter put on his facial disguise, and then they left
the restaurant.</p>

<p>Dora’s flat was situated on Thirty-ninth Street, next
to a theater. It was elaborately furnished in a style
that evinced more money than good taste, and Nick
almost shuddered at the array of showy furniture,
useless bric-a-brac, draperies, and ornaments which
crowded the little parlor into which she ushered him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter, I suppose you do not want to lose any
time,” she said, “so, if you will follow me, I will
conduct you to Darwin’s room.”</p>

<p>Carter followed Dora along a private hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>At last she opened a door, and led him into one of
the bedrooms, remarking:</p>

<p>“This is the room.”</p>

<p>After she had turned on the electric light, she looked
around, and then she uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>The room was in confusion.</p>

<p>Carter looked at Dora.</p>

<p>“He has been here and carted off all his things!”
Dora ejaculated, as soon as she recovered the use of
her voice.</p>

<p>“I thought you said he had no key?” Carter remarked.</p>

<p>“He has none. He must have come here before the
servant left.”</p>

<p>“What time does she leave?”</p>

<p>“Seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Where does she live?”</p>

<p>“On Twenty-seventh Street.”</p>

<p>While Carter was asking these questions, his eyes
were wandering about the room.</p>

<p>On the floor, in a corner, he spied several pieces of
paper.</p>

<p>He picked them up and smoothed them out.</p>

<p>Two were blanks.</p>

<p>The third had writing on it.</p>

<p>The detective read it.</p>

<p>His countenance brightened.</p>

<p>Dora noticed the change.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“A note,” replied the detective.</p>

<p>“From whom?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“Rich.”</p>

<p>“To Darwin?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“When was it written?”</p>

<p>“On the afternoon of the day before New Year’s.”</p>

<p>“Is it important?”</p>

<p>“It may be.”</p>

<p>“Will you read it?”</p>

<p>Nick examined her face intently.</p>

<p>“Do you still doubt me?” Dora asked.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Carter, after a pause.</p>

<p>Nick was satisfied.</p>

<p>“You can rely on me to help you, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“I know it now.”</p>

<p>“Will you read that note?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do so.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“‘December 31.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Dick</span>: I was at the Grand Central this
afternoon when he arrived. Followed him downtown
in a cab. He went to the safe deposit company’s office.
Have placed a party on his trail. Meet me at seven
o’clock to-night at the Knickerbocker Cottage. We
will dine together. Yours in haste,</p>

<p class="right">“‘<span class="smcap">Simeon</span>.’”</p>
</div>

<p>“Then Darwin was with Rich that night?”</p>

<p>“No doubt.”</p>

<p>Carter folded the paper and placed it carefully away
in his pocketbook. He looked upon this note as an important
piece of evidence. The “he” mentioned in it,
he felt confident, referred to the man who had been
murdered at the Red Dragon Inn.</p>

<p>According to this note, Rich and Darwin had dined
together at the Knickerbocker Cottage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>It would be an easy matter to find out what time
they left that place.</p>

<p>Another thing was clear, and that was that Darwin
had taken fright about something, or he never would
have removed his things from the flat in such haste.</p>

<p>Was this move an indication of guilt?</p>

<p>Carter turned to Dora, and asked:</p>

<p>“Do you know where Rich and his sister reside?”</p>

<p>“I do not,” Dora replied.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear Darwin speak of a woman named
Isabella Porter?”</p>

<p>“I know that woman.”</p>

<p>“Where does she live?”</p>

<p>“I do not know.”</p>

<p>“Did you know that Darwin and Rich were acquainted
with her?”</p>

<p>“Rich has known her ever since she was a small
girl.”</p>

<p>“What about Darwin?”</p>

<p>“He has only been acquainted with her a short time.”</p>

<p>“When did you first meet her?”</p>

<p>“She was in Rich’s company one night, and he introduced
her to me.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about her?”</p>

<p>“She is the daughter of a rich merchant, I believe.
Her mother and father are dead. She has an income.”</p>

<p>“Is that all you know?”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>It was too late to continue the inquiries further that
night, he concluded, and he determined to go home,
as long as he was uptown.</p>

<p>Carter was in a very thoughtful mood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Many curious events had happened during the past
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>He was walking along leisurely, with his head
bowed, thinking of plans for that day, and where
he would go to make inquiries, when his attention was
attracted to two men, who were walking ahead of him.</p>

<p>Instantly he raised his head and slackened his pace.</p>

<p>One of the men he recognized as Darwin.</p>

<p>The man’s companion he had never seen before.</p>

<p>He could not get near enough to the men to hear
their conversation.</p>

<p>At the corner of Fifty-second Street, the men separated,
and Darwin started in an easterly direction.</p>

<p>Carter decided to follow him, and he gave up the
idea of going home.</p>

<p>Darwin reached the east side of town, and turned
into Second Avenue.</p>

<p>“What business has he over here?” the detective
asked himself, as he kept on the trail of his quarry.</p>

<p>Between Forty-first and Fortieth Streets Darwin
halted under a street lamp.</p>

<p>From his pocket he took a slip of paper, consulted
it, and then went along examining the numbers of the
houses.</p>

<p>Carter stopped in the doorway of the corner store
and watched him.</p>

<p>At the same time he changed his disguise. He now
looked as tough as any of the night prowlers in the
questionable neighborhood.</p>

<p>Darwin entered a tall tenement.</p>

<p>Carter hurried out of his place of concealment.</p>

<p>He also went into the house and stood in the lower
hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>On each floor lights were burning.</p>

<p>As he looked up, he saw Darwin distinctly on the
next floor, and he heard him knock on the door of the
back room.</p>

<p>Darwin knocked a number of times, and no one
opened the door.</p>

<p>When he started to descend the stairs, Carter walked
out, and took up a position in a doorway of a house
near the corner.</p>

<p>Darwin came out of the tenement, walked to the
corner, and halted.</p>

<p>Back and forth he moved, and kept looking at the
house.</p>

<p>The detective saw that he was uneasy. He wondered
whom Darwin had come to see.</p>

<p>Darwin, after a time, came back to the tenement,
and entered again.</p>

<p>Carter did not move from his hiding place.</p>

<p>His quarry only remained inside a minute or so,
and then came out, going back to the corner and halting.</p>

<p>Carter came out of the doorway. He strolled up to
the corner, and stopped within a few feet of Darwin,
who saw and eyed him.</p>

<p>Two or three times the man made a movement as
if he were going to address Carter.</p>

<p>But he hesitated.</p>

<p>The detective made no attempt to speak. He looked
up and down the street, and appeared unconcerned.</p>

<p>Carter wanted to see if Darwin would speak to him.
He judged that if he waited long enough the man
would do so.</p>

<p>Darwin crossed the street, halted a moment, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
then came back. He glanced sharply, suspiciously, at
Carter.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” he said, as he came to a standstill,
“do you live around here?”</p>

<p>“Are you addressing me?” the detective asked, in a
disguised tone of voice.</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, yes, I live in that house down there,”
said Nick, pointing to the tall tenement which Darwin
had twice entered.</p>

<p>“You do? What floor do you live on?”</p>

<p>“The top. Why?”</p>

<p>“I want some information about one of the tenants.”</p>

<p>“Eh!”</p>

<p>Carter bent forward and looked at Darwin.</p>

<p>His acting was magnificent.</p>

<p>“Say, are you a fly cop?” he asked, with suspicion.</p>

<p>“No,” Darwin replied quickly, “I’m not a detective.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t got the cut of one.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“What do you want to know?”</p>

<p>“Are you acquainted with a woman named Lena
Peters?”</p>

<p>“You mean the woman who lives in the back room
on the second floor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p>“I know her by sight.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen her to-night?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been to her room and knocked, but no one
seems to be in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“Did you have an appointment with her?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly an appointment.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>For a time they were silent.</p>

<p>Then Carter said, in an offhand way:</p>

<p>“What does Miss Peters do?”</p>

<p>“She sings in a concert hall over on the West Side,”
Darwin replied.</p>

<p>“I often wondered what she worked at to keep her
out so late at night.”</p>

<p>“Will you see her when she comes in?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to remain here long?”</p>

<p>“All night.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“I watch stores on the block.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Why did you ask that question?”</p>

<p>“Will you deliver a message to Lena Peters when
she comes home?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Tell her that a gentleman named Richard called
to see her, and that he wants her to come to his room
the first thing after noon.”</p>

<p>“Where are your rooms?”</p>

<p>“She is familiar with the address.”</p>

<p>“Then she has called on you before?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“At your rooms?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever been down here before?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be sure and see Miss Peters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“Here’s a dollar for your trouble.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>Carter pocketed the money.</p>

<p>“I can depend on you?” Darwin asked uneasily.</p>

<p>“You can,” the detective replied, and he hardly was
able to repress a smile.</p>

<p>“Good night.”</p>

<p>Darwin hurried away.</p>

<p>Carter did not budge from the corner.</p>

<p>That he had formed some new plan in his mind was
evident, or he would have made a move to keep on
the trail of his quarry.</p>

<p>“He said the woman’s name was Peters—Lena
Peters,” the detective muttered, a few minutes after
Darwin had disappeared around the corner. “She has
seen him a number of times. Can she be any relation
to the man who died in Bellevue Hospital? If she
is——”</p>

<p>Carter stopped musing, as he saw a woman, who
had hurried around the corner, enter the tenement.</p>

<p>Instantly he started toward the house, and went in.</p>

<p>The woman was halfway up the stairs.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>LENA’S STORY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Carter had entered the lower hall of the house without
making any noise.</p>

<p>The woman’s attention was not attracted toward
him, so he stood back in the shadow and watched her.</p>

<p>She reached the landing, and, stopping in front of
the door of the back room, she inserted a key in the
lock, opened the door and went in.</p>

<p>Nick knocked on the door of the room.</p>

<p>The woman opened the door.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” she demanded, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Is your name Lena Peters?” the detective asked.</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“I want to talk with you.”</p>

<p>Carter pushed his way into the room without ceremony,
and closed the door.</p>

<p>The woman’s face became flushed with anger. She
stepped back from the detective, and her eyes flashed.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” she demanded, with a string
of oaths, and she pulled out of her pocket a small
pistol.</p>

<p>“Don’t get excited,” Carter quietly said, with a
scornful smile. “Put up your pistol, Lena. I’m not
going to harm you.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you in a few moments.”</p>

<p>“You are a stranger to me.”</p>

<p>“I guess not.”</p>

<p>As Carter said this, he pulled off his disguise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>Lena uttered a scream, and sank down into a chair.</p>

<p>“Nick Carter!” she gasped, and the pistol fell from
her grasp into her lap.</p>

<p>“You recognize me now?” the detective said, with
a smile, as he sat down.</p>

<p>From this it will be seen that he and the woman
had met before.</p>

<p>After a pause, Carter remarked:</p>

<p>“Let me see, Lena, it is several years since we have
had the pleasure of meeting. You haven’t changed any
since I last saw you.”</p>

<p>“No,” Lena stammered.</p>

<p>“At that time you were singing at the Empire, on
the Bowery, if my memory does not play me false.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“A Western divine was robbed in the place of a
large sum of money, and you were charged with the
theft. It was a cowardly charge. I investigated the
case——”</p>

<p>“And you found out that I was innocent.”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>“Only for you, I might have been sent to prison.”</p>

<p>“Correct.”</p>

<p>“I——”</p>

<p>“Lena?”</p>

<p>Carter paused, and looked straight into the woman’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I want you to give me some information.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter, I have always declared that if I could
ever do you a favor for what you did for me I would
do it.”</p>

<p>“Now is your chance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“What do you want to know?”</p>

<p>“Are you acquainted with a man named Dick Darwin?”</p>

<p>“Yes—why——”</p>

<p>“You have called on him a number of times?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“He has a room in the Studio Building, at the corner
of Twenty-sixth Street and Broadway.”</p>

<p>“How long have you known him?”</p>

<p>“Only a few weeks.”</p>

<p>“How did you become acquainted with him?”</p>

<p>“I——”</p>

<p>Lena hesitated. She looked at the detective, and her
face turned pale.</p>

<p>Carter kept his eyes riveted upon her.</p>

<p>“Lena,” he said, “you must not try to conceal anything
from me.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter, did Darwin employ you?” Lena asked.</p>

<p>“No. Why?”</p>

<p>“I just wanted to know.”</p>

<p>“What if he had employed me?”</p>

<p>“I am unable to say.”</p>

<p>Lena moved about uneasily in her chair.</p>

<p>Carter kept still.</p>

<p>He was giving the woman plenty of time to think.</p>

<p>There was no need to hurry, for he was confident
that he would get out of her all the information he
desired.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter, what do you know about Dick Darwin?”
Lena finally blurted out.</p>

<p>“Very little,” the detective replied. “I want to learn
what you know about him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“You are as sphinxlike as ever.”</p>

<p>“I have to be.”</p>

<p>Another silence followed.</p>

<p>Lena arose from her chair and walked back and
forth across the room several times. She resumed her
seat again.</p>

<p>“I will tell you everything!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“That is right,” the detective said, in an encouraging
tone.</p>

<p>Lena leaned back in her chair, and for some moments
she sat with head bowed.</p>

<p>At length she looked up at the detective, and said:</p>

<p>“I had a brother, whose name was Edward Peters.</p>

<p>“He was employed by a Mrs. Porter, who lived
on Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>“About ten years ago he was stabbed in the back,
and he died in Bellevue Hospital.</p>

<p>“I always believed that some one murdered him, although
I could never secure any evidence to prove it.</p>

<p>“He had for a chum a man named George
Blanchard.</p>

<p>“Blanchard also died in the hospital.</p>

<p>“Previous to his death he made some kind of a
confession to my brother in regard to a will case.</p>

<p>“I tried to get out of my brother what the confession
was about, but he would not tell me.</p>

<p>“Three months ago I was looking through a trunk
which contained some things belonging to my brother,
and I found an old memorandum book.</p>

<p>“I opened it, and I was surprised to find written in
it a short account of Blanchard’s confession.</p>

<p>“I was interested.</p>

<p>“At the end of the confession I found a note.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“I will get the book and read it to you.”</p>

<p>“Do so.”</p>

<p>Lena got up, walked over to a bureau, opened a
drawer, took out a small, leather-bound book, returned
to her seat, opened the book and commenced to read:</p>

<p>“‘This night I stopped at the Red Dragon Inn. I
gave the confession of Blanchard to the proprietor to
lock up in his safe. I have seen Simeon Rich three
times. I have told him that unless he pays me ten
thousand dollars I will take Blanchard’s confession to
the district attorney. I did not let him know where
I had put the documents. No one knows about the
contents of the papers except myself. Doctor Thompson
did not ask to read the confession when he signed
his name as a witness.</p>

<p>“‘Rich has promised to raise the money in a few
days.’”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” Carter asked, when Lena stopped
reading.</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“Let me have that book.”</p>

<p>“Here it is.”</p>

<p>The detective glanced at some of the pages, and
then placed the book in his pocket.</p>

<p>“What did you do after reading that memorandum?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I knew Simeon Rich,” Lena replied. “I met him
some years ago. As soon as I read that memorandum
I made up my mind that Rich would have to pay me
well to keep silent.</p>

<p>“The thought came to me that perhaps he might
have had a hand in my brother’s death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“I knew that Rich was quite sweet on Isabella
Porter, the daughter of the woman for whom my
brother had worked.”</p>

<p>“She is dead now—I mean Mrs. Porter.”</p>

<p>“Did you see Rich?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I hunted him up.”</p>

<p>“Where was he living?”</p>

<p>“In the Studio Building, with Darwin, to whom he
introduced me.”</p>

<p>“How did you find that out?”</p>

<p>“I called on Miss Porter, whom I knew was living
at the Gerlach.”</p>

<p>“What did you say to Rich?”</p>

<p>“I told him that I knew about the confession, and
I knew where it was.”</p>

<p>“Was he frightened?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He held a conference with Darwin, and he
then told me that they would let me know how much
they would pay me.</p>

<p>“I demanded ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>“We have had several conversations about the matter,
and a few days ago I called on Darwin, and he
gave me five thousand dollars on account.</p>

<p>“I then gave him a copy of the memorandum in
regard to the papers having been left with the proprietor
of the Red Dragon Inn.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen him since then?”</p>

<p>“Once.”</p>

<p>“Did he pay you any more money?”</p>

<p>“No, but he promised to do so.”</p>

<p>From what Lena said, Carter knew now how it
was that Rich had learned of the existence of the
Blanchard confession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>The case was becoming clearer to the detective.</p>

<p>But, still, for all that, he had not secured any positive
evidence to prove that Rich had anything to do
with the murder.</p>

<p>“Lena,” he said, “you say that you believe your
brother was murdered?”</p>

<p>“I do,” the woman replied.</p>

<p>“Do you think Rich had anything to do with it?”</p>

<p>“I am not sure.”</p>

<p>“Will you be guided by me?”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>“I want you to put on your things and accompany
me.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to place me under arrest?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then, what?”</p>

<p>“I am going to take you to my house. I want you to
remain there until I have finished the case upon which
I am at work.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“The mystery of the Red Dragon Inn.”</p>

<p>“And you suspect Rich?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“I have been reading about that case.”</p>

<p>“You have?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it has seemed strange to me that the
detectives have not been able to find a clew.”</p>

<p>“Will you accompany me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I may need your assistance.”</p>

<p>“I will help you, Mr. Carter, gladly.”</p>

<p>“Let us start.”</p>

<p>Lena put on her hat and coat, packed a few articles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
in a valise, and then she and the detective left the
tenement.</p>

<p>Day was dawning when Carter reached his home.
He conducted Lena to Mrs. Peters, his housekeeper,
who gave her a room, in which she promised to remain.</p>

<p>Nick gave her a few instructions, and then he retired
to his own room, where he threw himself down
upon a couch and went to sleep.</p>

<p>It was late in the morning when Carter awoke. He
had an interview with Lena, and then, after partaking
of a light breakfast, he went downtown. Chickering
Carter and Patsy Garvan, his two chief assistants,
were engaged upon another case—in which, by the
way, Nick was fated to play a prominent part—so he
did not see them that morning.</p>

<p>Nick stepped into the Cosmopolitan Hotel, and saw
Mr. Wright, who informed him that his room had been
entered during the night by some one.</p>

<p>“I think I know who it was,” the detective remarked,
and then he departed, feeling sure that the person who
had entered the room was Brockey Gann.</p>

<p>It tickled him to think that the rascal had been
disappointed.</p>

<p>Carter called at police headquarters, and there he
learned that other detectives had not made a discovery.
He informed the chief inspector that he was
following a promising clew, and that he might be able
to render a report in a few days.</p>

<p>After leaving headquarters, he went uptown to the
Knickerbocker Cottage. There he questioned the
waiters, and at last he found the man who had served
Rich and Darwin on New Year’s Eve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Did you hear any of their conversation?” the detective
asked the waiter.</p>

<p>“Only a little,” the man answered. “They talked
about some man who had just arrived in the city.”</p>

<p>“Was any name mentioned?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Can you recall it?”</p>

<p>“I think it was Lawrence.”</p>

<p>“What did they say about him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“What time did they leave here?”</p>

<p>“About half past ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear them mention where they were going?”</p>

<p>“A messenger boy brought Rich a note. He read
it, and then I heard him remark that they had better
hurry down to McKeever’s saloon.”</p>

<p>“Was that all?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Did you notice the number of the messenger?”</p>

<p>“It was seven-twenty-one.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the boy?”</p>

<p>“He is attached to the office on Broadway and
Thirtieth Street.”</p>

<p>The waiter was unable to give the detective any
more information.</p>

<p>Carter hurried to the office of the district messenger
company.</p>

<p>There he found the messenger boy.</p>

<p>“Do you remember delivering a note on New Year’s
Eve to a man who was dining at the Knickerbocker
Cottage?” the detective asked the messenger.</p>

<p>“Was he a tall man?” the boy queried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He was with a short, stout man?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I gave him the note.”</p>

<p>“From whom did you receive it?”</p>

<p>“A man.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever see him before?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Can you describe him?”</p>

<p>“He was pock-marked.”</p>

<p>“Was he a tough?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Would you be able to recognize him again?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Carter gave the boy a bill and told him not to mention
their conversation to a soul.</p>

<p>From the boy’s description he recognized Brockey
Gann.</p>

<p>At McKeever’s saloon the detective was fortunate
enough to find the bartender who had been on duty
on New Year’s Eve. He was acquainted with the man,
and as soon as he made himself known to him he
readily answered all his questions.</p>

<p>They retired into a back room together, and as soon
as they were seated Carter asked:</p>

<p>“Are you acquainted with a man named Simeon
Rich?”</p>

<p>“I know who he is,” the bartender replied.</p>

<p>“Do you remember if he was in here on New Year’s
Eve?”</p>

<p>“He was here with two men.”</p>

<p>“At what time?”</p>

<p>“It was about eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“Do you know the men who were with him?”</p>

<p>“One of the men was Brockey Gann—the other
man I do not know, although I have seen him several
times.”</p>

<p>“How long did they remain here?”</p>

<p>“Only a few minutes. They held a whispered conversation
and then went out.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything they said?”</p>

<p>“Not a word.”</p>

<p>This information only established one fact, and that
was that Rich, Darwin, and Brockey were together on
New Year’s Eve.</p>

<p>Carter left the saloon.</p>

<p>He stood on the corner some time trying to determine
what he ought to do next. He was almost
positive that Brockey Gann was the scoundrel who
had tracked the murdered man.</p>

<p>But how was he going to prove that?</p>

<p>This was a conundrum.</p>

<p>After a time Carter crossed the street and entered
the establishment of a costumer.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>ACTING A PART.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Carter secured a disguise from the costumer.</p>

<p>When he came out he looked like a typical tough.</p>

<p>Nick had some plan in his mind. He was sure that
he was on the right trail, and that, such being the
case, it would not be long before he would have forged
every link in the chain of evidence.</p>

<p>While he was confident of success, still he did not
know for a certainty who had committed the dastardly
crime at the Red Dragon Inn, or what the real motive
was.</p>

<p>He had suspicions, and he had collected strong circumstantial
evidence.</p>

<p>But he wanted something more than this, and he
was prepared to take any risk to obtain it. On his
way downtown he stopped at a telephone station and
called up Patsy, whose whereabouts he knew.</p>

<p>“Meet me downtown at my den within two hours,”
he said.</p>

<p>At last he reached Lem Samson’s saloon, and entered.</p>

<p>A bartender was on duty.</p>

<p>Samson was not in the place.</p>

<p>Only a few hangers-on were lolling about.</p>

<p>Carter staggered up to the bar, and, calling for a
drink, he cast his eyes about the room.</p>

<p>No one seemed to be paying any particular attention
to him.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the men had records, and were known
to the police.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>The detective poured the liquor into a cuspidor when
the bartender’s back was turned. It was vile stuff,
and he would not have drunk it unless he had been
forced to do so by dire expediency.</p>

<p>After placing the glass back on the bar he walked
into the back room and sat down. He picked up a
copy of a sporting weekly and pretended to be deeply
interested in examining the text and pictures.</p>

<p>But while he seemed to be reading, his eyes were
wandering about the room, and every person who entered
the barroom he scrutinized closely.</p>

<p>He was waiting for some one.</p>

<p>Was that some one Brockey?</p>

<p>Half an hour passed.</p>

<p>Carter had not stirred out of his chair.</p>

<p>The side door opened.</p>

<p>A man entered.</p>

<p>The man was Brockey Gann.</p>

<p>The detective saw him.</p>

<p>Still he did not move.</p>

<p>No change took place in his countenance.</p>

<p>Not a muscle moved.</p>

<p>Brockey looked around the back room.</p>

<p>His eyes fell on Carter, whose eyes were bent on
the paper.</p>

<p>Brockey started, bent forward, and a change took
place in the expression of his evil face. He uttered
an ugly oath and stepped up to Carter, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Why, Mugsey Donovan, when did you get out?”</p>

<p>Carter looked up, smiled inanely—a weak, silly,
maudlin grin!—and replied:</p>

<p>“How are you, Brockey? Wot’s dot youse said?
Sit down an’ have a ball wid me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“I asked you when you got out?”</p>

<p>“Six weeks ago. Wot cher goin’ ter have? Name
yer pisen?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take some of the rosy.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been on de tramp. I just dropped in here
tinkin’ I’d run up agin’ youse.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>The bartender brought the liquor, and the two men
were silent.</p>

<p>It will be well to explain that Mugsey Donovan was
an old pal of Brockey’s, whom Carter had arrested
and sent to prison for highway robbery.</p>

<p>The rascal was still in Sing Sing.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the detective’s disguise must
have been perfect to have deceived Brockey as it did.</p>

<p>The scoundrel actually believed that he was talking
to his old pal.</p>

<p>“How is it you got out so soon?” Brockey asked,
after he had swallowed his liquor.</p>

<p>“Dey reduced me sentence,” the detective rejoined.</p>

<p>“How was that?”</p>

<p>“I saved one o’ de keepers’ life.”</p>

<p>“Go way!”</p>

<p>“I ain’t jollyin’ you.”</p>

<p>“How did you do it?”</p>

<p>“An insane mug tried to escape from his cell. De
keeper catched him an’ den he made an attempt to kill
de keeper. I seed it an’ knocked ter mug out, see? Den
de jailer petitioned de guvnor ter lea’ me out.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Dat’s what I wanted to see youse about.”</p>

<p>“I’m not into anything.”</p>

<p>“Youse are not?” asked Nick dubiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“What do you mean by looking at me in that way?”</p>

<p>“Brockey, dis isn’t a safe place ter talk.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Lea’ go some place where we kin talk wid safety.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you.”</p>

<p>“Brockey, don’ youse try ter gi’ an’ old pal like me
any sich a bluff as dat!”</p>

<p>“Mugsey——”</p>

<p>“Brockey, I’m on to yer game.”</p>

<p>“You are on to my game?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Come——”</p>

<p>“Le’s go some place where we kin talk wid safety.”
Brockey looked intently at the detective.</p>

<p>“I can’t see what’s in your nut,” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>“Do youse want to talk over private matters here?”
Carter asked, and Brockey drawled:</p>

<p>“No-o.”</p>

<p>“Den le’s go down ter some quiet joint.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be hanged!”</p>

<p>“Brockey, I knows wot game youse is working?”</p>

<p>“I am working no game. I’m on my uppers.”</p>

<p>“Don’t try ter gi’ me eny game like dat, now, ’cause
I’m on to de hull layout.”</p>

<p>“You——”</p>

<p>“Wait.”</p>

<p>“I——”</p>

<p>“Brockey Gann, I tort youse’s never’d go back on
an old pal in dis way.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going back on you, Mugsey.”</p>

<p>“Youse is when youse refuse to let me in on de
game, so dat I kin git some o’ de graft.”</p>

<p>“You talk in riddles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“I seed one t’ing.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to speak more plain.”</p>

<p>“You will.”</p>

<p>“Den here goes—don’t youse blame me if eny one
hears it an’ youse git into a trap. Las’ winter youse
was paid to——”</p>

<p>“Wait, Mugsey.”</p>

<p>Brockey bent forward.</p>

<p>A strange expression was in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m waitin’, Brockey,” Carter said, and he returned
the rascal’s searching gaze.</p>

<p>“Where were you last night?” Brockey asked.</p>

<p>Carter laughed.</p>

<p>“Youse is comin’ to yer milk now, Brockey,” he
remarked.</p>

<p>“Were you in this place last night?”</p>

<p>“Wot’s de use o’ talking here? It ain’t safe, Brockey.
Le’ me gi’ you a tip. Nick Carter may turn up here
eny moment, an’ youse an’ me might not be able to git
on to him, see?”</p>

<p>Brockey uttered an oath. His face turned pale. He
glanced over his shoulder and his eyes wandered about
the room.</p>

<p>“Ain’t my advice sensible?” the detective asked.</p>

<p>“I guess it is,” Brockey replied.</p>

<p>“Den le’s git out o’ here.”</p>

<p>“All right. But I’ll be hanged if I can understand
what——”</p>

<p>“I’ll explain everything, Brockey.”</p>

<p>“Where’ll we go?”</p>

<p>“Ter a quiet crib dat I knows about.”</p>

<p>“Is it far?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“No.”</p>

<p>The two men arose from the table and hurried out
of the saloon.</p>

<p>Carter was playing a dangerous game.</p>

<p>Would he be able to carry it through successfully
to the end?</p>

<p>At any moment he was liable to make a slip and
Brockey would then be able to penetrate his disguise.</p>

<p>So far he had deceived the rascal.</p>

<p>As they left the saloon the detective breathed easier.
He had succeeded in getting Brockey away from
his friends.</p>

<p>That was a great point gained.</p>

<p>They turned into Macdougal Street.</p>

<p>“Where are you goin’?” Brockey asked, after they
had reached Fourth Street.</p>

<p>“Not far,” Carter replied. “I’ve got a room around
here in Fo’rt’ Street.”</p>

<p>“When did you hire it?”</p>

<p>“Ter-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Here it is.”</p>

<p>The detective led the way into a private house.</p>

<p>Brockey’s suspicions were not aroused.</p>

<p>If he had been aware that he was being led into a
trap like a lamb to slaughter he would have then and
there made a desperate fight.</p>

<p>Carter had rented a room in this house for years,
and he had used it frequently. He opened the door
of the room with a key.</p>

<p>The house was as quiet as a graveyard.</p>

<p>“This is a quiet joint,” Brockey said, as he followed
the detective into the room and gazed around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>There was nothing about the place to indicate for
what purpose it had been used by the detective. It
was nothing more, to all outward appearances, than a
plainly furnished bedroom.</p>

<p>“Take a seat, Brockey,” said Carter blandly, and at
the same time he turned the key in the lock, took it
out, and put it into his pocket.</p>

<p>“I wish you had some liquor about here,” Brockey
remarked, as he sank down into a chair.</p>

<p>“I kin accommodate youse.”</p>

<p>“Can you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Carter opened a bureau drawer, took out a bottle
and glasses and placed them on the table.</p>

<p>Brockey poured out a glassful of the liquor and
drank it.</p>

<p>A few minutes after it was down a look of surprise
spread over his face.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” he exclaimed. “Where did you get that,
Mugsey?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t it rich?” Carter asked, with a smile.</p>

<p>“It’s more than rich.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“I swiped it off a drunk.”</p>

<p>“I thought you didn’t pay for it.”</p>

<p>“Le’ us talk bizness now.”</p>

<p>Brockey’s countenance changed. He leaned back
in his chair, looked at the detective, and made no reply.</p>

<p>Carter was silent for a time, and then said:</p>

<p>“Brockey, as I said down in Samson’s joint, I be
on ter your game.”</p>

<p>“And I’d like to know how you got on to it,”
Brockey growled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“I’ll tell youse after a while.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“Youse is mixed up in de Red Dragon Inn murder!”</p>

<p>“My Gawd!”</p>

<p>Brockey bounded out of his chair as if he had received
a shock of electricity. His face was the color
of ashes. He stood still and gasped at Carter.</p>

<p>“Youse needn’t t’row a fit,” the detective ejaculated.
“Dere ain’t no fly cop around here to hear me an’
pinch youse.”</p>

<p>“I’m a fool,” Brockey exclaimed as he wiped the
cold perspiration from his brow and sat down in his
chair again.</p>

<p>“Rest easy, me covey.”</p>

<p>“But, Mugsey, you puzzle me.”</p>

<p>“Do I?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Carter laughed.</p>

<p>“Fire ahead,” Brockey said.</p>

<p>“Two rich blokes hired you to put Carter out o’
de way.</p>

<p>“Un o’ dem’s named Darwin an’ de oder Rich——”</p>

<p>“I——”</p>

<p>“Wait.”</p>

<p>“I——”</p>

<p>“Es I said—dey hired youse, an’ las’ night youse
broke into old Wright’s room at de Cosmopolitan
Hotel an’ youse got sold.”</p>

<p>“Mugsey——”</p>

<p>“Gi’ me a chance to git through.”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“Now, I knows all dese tings, an’ I know how much
youse got—an’ want a slice o’ de dough, see?”</p>

<p>“And if I don’t agree to give up?”</p>

<p>“Den I’ll go to yer friend, Carter.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t do that?”</p>

<p>“Jess youse try ter t’row me down an’ youse’ll see
wot I’ll do.”</p>

<p>“Mugsey——”</p>

<p>“Brockey, youse’ve got to come ter time.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I’ll have to.”</p>

<p>“Youse kin gamble on dat.”</p>

<p>“If I give up you’ll have to help me.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“I’ll introduce you to Rich and Darwin.”</p>

<p>“Tell me de full lay.”</p>

<p>“Tell me how you got onto what you know.”</p>

<p>“I piped youse.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Las’ nite.”</p>

<p>“Was that all?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Humph!”</p>

<p>“Doan git so disgusted.”</p>

<p>“I’m not.”</p>

<p>“Tell me de hull lay.”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>Brockey became silent.</p>

<p>Carter’s eyes sparkled as he watched his companion.</p>

<p>His heart was beating rapidly, but outwardly he
appeared composed.</p>

<p>Patiently he waited for Brockey to commence to
speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“Would the rascal speak the truth?” he asked himself.</p>

<p>Brockey was liable to tell a false story.</p>

<p>“I know more dan youse t’ink, Brockey,” Carter remarked.
“So if youse go ter givin’ me any fairy tales
I’ll be down on youse wid all me force.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell you all about the lay,” Brockey
replied, as he aroused himself out of his reverie.</p>

<p>“Den fire ahead.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get impatient.”</p>

<p>“I’m not.”</p>

<p>“Have you got anything to smoke?”</p>

<p>“Cert.”</p>

<p>“Then set it out.”</p>

<p>Carter placed some cigars on the table.</p>

<p>Brockey picked up one, lit it, and commenced to
smoke.</p>

<p>With a sigh, he settled himself back in the chair.</p>

<p>Another silence followed, and it was nearly five
minutes before he commenced to talk.</p>

<small>CAUGHT IN A TRAP.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“I want to tell you one thing, Mugsey,” Brockey
exclaimed suddenly, sitting bolt upright in his chair.
“I’m not as deep in this affair of the Red Dragon Inn
as you suspect.”</p>

<p>“Don’ gi’ me any o’ dat,” Carter rejoined, blowing
a cloud of smoke up in the air over his head.</p>

<p>“Upon my honor, what I tell you is the truth.”</p>

<p>Carter could not help smiling when Brockey spoke
of his honor.</p>

<p>Such a scoundrel as that does not know what
honor is!</p>

<p>The detective knew well that Brockey had no honor,
that he would lie, steal, and if he found himself in a
tight place, he would not hesitate to betray an accomplice,
if by so doing he could save himself.</p>

<p>Brockey noticed the smile, and he flared up instantly.</p>

<p>“What are you smiling at, Mugsey?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Youse,” Carter replied, without moving a muscle,
and he puffed away at his cigar, unconcernedly.</p>

<p>“You are laughing at me?”</p>

<p>“Cert.”</p>

<p>“I——”</p>

<p>“Youse gi’ me a pain! Go on wid yer story.”</p>

<p>“I want to know——”</p>

<p>“Drop it.”</p>

<p>“What were you laughing at?”</p>

<p>“When <i>youse</i> talk o’ honor it’s ’nuff ter make a
dorg laff.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“Is——”</p>

<p>“Come, Brockey—we’s understand each udder—speel
ahead, neider of us has got any honor, fur dat
matter.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Brockey quieted down. He took several pulls at his
cigar, and then he continued:</p>

<p>“As I said, I’m not as deep in that Red Dragon
Inn affair as you think.”</p>

<p>“Let it go at dat.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you all about the affair, Mugsey.</p>

<p>“Then you and I can put our heads together and
decide what to do.”</p>

<p>“We’ll gi’ dem a good song and dance—make no
mistake o’ dat.”</p>

<p>“How shall I start?”</p>

<p>“At de beginnin’.”</p>

<p>“How else would I start?”</p>

<p>“Youse might start at de tail.”</p>

<p>“That will do.”</p>

<p>“Youse is wastin’ time.”</p>

<p>“Then keep quiet.”</p>

<p>“I’m mum.”</p>

<p>“Listen.”</p>

<p>Brockey cleared his throat.</p>

<p>“It was the day before New Year’s,” he said.</p>

<p>“I was down on my luck and I hadn’t a cent in my
pocket.</p>

<p>“Not in a long time had I been in such a hole.</p>

<p>“I tried to touch a dozen o’ the gang, but every
one seemed to be in the same boat.</p>

<p>“No one could show me a cent.</p>

<p>“I was at Samson’s saloon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“Along about four o’clock a bloke came in.</p>

<p>“It was Sim Rich.</p>

<p>“Darwin had given me a knockdown to him some
time before.</p>

<p>“At a glance I saw that he was excited about something.</p>

<p>“He spied me, came up, caught hold of my arm,
dragged me after him out of the saloon, pushed me
into a cab and ordered the cabby to hurry up and not
lose sight of another cab that was just turning into
Broadway.</p>

<p>“My breath was taken away.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know what to make of Rich’s actions.</p>

<p>“The cab started, and before I could utter a word,
Rich said:</p>

<p>“‘Brockey, I need your assistance.’</p>

<p>“‘You can have it, if you pay for it,’ I replied.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll pay,’ Rich said.</p>

<p>“‘Then what is it you want me to do?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘I want you to track a man.’</p>

<p>“Well, Rich pulled out a roll of bills and staked
me with a hundred. He told me that in the cab which
we were following was a man whom he hated and
whom he wanted to locate.</p>

<p>“As soon as I found out where the man was going
to put up I was to send him word.</p>

<p>“Rich got out of the cab.</p>

<p>“Before he did so he told me he was going to dine
that night at the Knickerbocker Cottage, and I could
send him word there.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t Rich keep in wid youse?”</p>

<p>“He said he wanted to meet Darwin. He was in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
very nervous condition, and another thing I saw that
he had been drinking heavily.</p>

<p>“Well, he got out, and I kept on the bloke’s trail.</p>

<p>“Finally the first cab stopped at the corner of Broadway
and Sixteenth Street.</p>

<p>“My cab stopped on the next corner.</p>

<p>“I got out in a hurry, and I saw an old man get
out of the other cab.”</p>

<p>“Wot was de number of de cab youse was in?”</p>

<p>“Number one hundred and forty-seven.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“As I said, an old man got out of the other cab.
I got close up to him when he was paying the driver,
and I heard him tell the man that he would not need
him any longer.</p>

<p>“As the old bloke walked off I noticed that he had
the lock step.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” interposed Nick.</p>

<p>“I do. At first I was not sure, but as I followed him
and noted every action, I knew that he had been a
guest at the big hotel up the river. He looked respectable
enough, but there was the stamp of the prison on
him.</p>

<p>“I followed the old fellow around all evening. He
stopped in at a number of places and he seemed to be
looking for some one.</p>

<p>“About ten o’clock he entered a restaurant on Sixth
Avenue, and sat down at one of the tables.</p>

<p>“I went to the office of the district messenger company,
wrote a note, and sent it to Rich, asking him to
meet me at McKeever’s place.</p>

<p>“In a short time he and Darwin met me in the
saloon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“We all had a drink.</p>

<p>“Then Rich listened to what I had to say about the
old man.</p>

<p>“When we got outside of the saloon Rich said that
he wouldn’t need me any more that night, but he might
the next day.”</p>

<p>“And youse went off to blow in de hundred plunks?”</p>

<p>“Of course I did.”</p>

<p>“Den youse don’ know wot Rich an’ Darwin did?”</p>

<p>“I surmise.”</p>

<p>“Wot?”</p>

<p>“Rich and Darwin followed the old cove until they
cornered him at the Red Dragon Inn.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then Rich got into the place and—you can imagine
the rest.”</p>

<p>“Youse don’t know fer a certainty?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see it done.”</p>

<p>“Was Rich familiar with the Red Dragon Inn?”</p>

<p>“Darwin told me that he used to go there years
ago.”</p>

<p>Carter had stopped using the tough vernacular, but
Brockey did not notice it.</p>

<p>The detective was slightly disappointed. He thought
at first that Brockey knew more about the crime. But
still, the rascal’s evidence would show that Rich and
Darwin had said that they would follow the old man.</p>

<p>“Did Darwin tell you whether he or Rich followed
the old man after you left them?” Carter asked.</p>

<p>“He did not,” Brockey replied. “But I guess Rich
was the one.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“Didn’t you read about what the bartender had to
say?”</p>

<p>“You mean about the tall man who entered the barroom
after the old man?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is that all you know?”</p>

<p>“It is, Mugsey.”</p>

<p>“I think you know more.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Carter, while he was talking, rose from his chair,
holding one of his hands in the side pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>Brockey did not move.</p>

<p>Even when the detective drew up near to him he
did not suspect that he was in any danger. He poured
out another glass full of liquor and drank it.</p>

<p>As he was in the act of placing the glass back on
the table Carter caught hold of him, and, before he
could move or utter a word, the detective had the
handcuffs clasped around his wrists.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” Brockey ejaculated, with
a fierce oath, and, as he tried to jump to his feet, he
faced the pistol which Carter pointed at him.</p>

<p>The detective pulled off his disguise.</p>

<p>Brockey recognized him. He uttered a cry of terror,
his face turned pale with alarm, and he sank down
into his chair.</p>

<p>“Carter!” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes, and you’re my prisoner,” the detective smilingly
replied.</p>

<p>“I’m done for.”</p>

<p>“There is not the slightest room for doubt, my dear
Brockey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“I never thought I’d be taken in in such a way—curse
the luck!”</p>

<p>“There will be no chance for you to escape this
time.”</p>

<p>“If I had suspected——”</p>

<p>“You would have tried to have killed me.”</p>

<p>“I would.”</p>

<p>From his pocket Nick pulled out a silk cord.</p>

<p>With it he bound Brockey’s arms and legs so tight
that there was no chance for the rascal to escape.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with me?” Brockey
asked, when Carter had finished binding him.</p>

<p>“I am going to let you remain here for the present,”
the detective answered.</p>

<p>“Alone?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!”</p>

<p>Brockey subsided into sullen silence, and glared
fiercely at Carter.</p>

<p>Inwardly he cursed him.</p>

<p>The detective walked to the door and unlocked and
opened it. Then he stepped out into the hall and gave
a peculiar whistle.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Patsy bounded up the stairs from
the floor below.</p>

<p>“What do you want, Mr. Carter?” the young man
asked as he confronted his chief.</p>

<p>“I have a prisoner in that room,” Carter replied,
pointing toward the room. “I want you to guard
him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>“See that you do, Patsy. If he should escape, my
case might be ruined.”</p>

<p>“He won’t get a chance to escape.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“I hope not.”</p>

<p>“Who is it?”</p>

<p>“Brockey Gann.”</p>

<p>“Gee!”</p>

<p>“You know him?”</p>

<p>“I should say I do.”</p>

<p>“He is a dangerous rascal.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have the honor of capturing him. I
don’t see how you accomplished it.”</p>

<p>“I tricked him.”</p>

<p>The young man entered the room and inspected
Brockey.</p>

<p>Carter loitered outside in the hall for a few minutes
and then he commenced to descend the stairs. He had
considerable faith in his young assistant, and he was
confident that Patsy would guard the prisoner as well
as he would himself.</p>

<p>In that respect his mind was easy.</p>

<p>In the lower hall he made a few changes in his disguise
and then he left the house.</p>

<p>He went up to the Grand Central Station and commenced
to inspect the cabmen.</p>

<p>At last he found cab No. 147.</p>

<p>“Hello! How are you?”</p>

<p>The man looked at him for a moment and then
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Hello! How are ye?”</p>

<p>“Pretty well.”</p>

<p>“Did you stick to the trail of that old bloke the
other night?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Carter had made himself up in such a manner that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
he looked like Brockey. He was delighted when the
cabman recognized him as the thug.</p>

<p>“Who was he?” the cabby asked, after a silence.</p>

<p>“He was the man who was murdered at the Red
Dragon Inn.”</p>

<p>“You are joking!”</p>

<p>“I am not,” protested Nick.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to stand in your shoes.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“The fly cops’ll get on to your following the old
cove.”</p>

<p>“They won’t if you don’t tell.”</p>

<p>“I might make some money by telling.”</p>

<p>“You won’t do that?”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“You’ll get an innocent man into a hole.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. But, I say, where’s the tall mug?”</p>

<p>“Who do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean the man who employed me.”</p>

<p>“I thought you knew him?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” said the cabman. “He just picked
me up here at the depot and he ordered me to follow
the other mug.</p>

<p>“I thought he was a detective.”</p>

<p>“You know who he is?”</p>

<p>“Honestly, I do not.”</p>

<p>“Would you call on him if I should give you his
name and address?”</p>

<p>“Of course, I would.”</p>

<p>“What will you do?”</p>

<p>“I’ll make him come down with the rocks.”</p>

<p>“Will you whack up with me?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“You’ll play square?”</p>

<p>“I swear it.”</p>

<p>“His name is Simeon Rich, and he lives in the
Studio Building, at the corner of Broadway and
Thirty-first Street.”</p>

<p>“Gosh!”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to get some one to mind my rig and
I’m going to call on Mr. Rich.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see you downtown.”</p>

<p>Carter hurried away. He stopped at a saloon and
made a change in his disguise in the back room.</p>

<p>When he came out he was just in time to see cabby
No. 147 making a bee line down Park Avenue. He
started after him.</p>

<p>What object had Carter in view when he gave
Rich’s name and address to the cabman?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>BLACKMAIL.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The cabman did not allow the grass to grow under
his feet.</p>

<p>It did not take him long to reach the Studio Building.</p>

<p>“He’s a rascal,” Carter commented, as he tracked
the cabman; “I can make use of him.”</p>

<p>The detective was amused.</p>

<p>That he had formulated some shrewd move was
quite certain from the manner in which he was acting.</p>

<p>The cabman entered the Studio Building.</p>

<p>Carter was close behind him.</p>

<p>Not for an instant did the man suspect that he was
the person who had given Rich’s name and address
to him.</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Rich live here?” the cabman asked of
the elevator boy.</p>

<p>Carter was standing in the elevator, and he heard
what was said.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rich lives on the top floor,” the boy replied
to the cabman.</p>

<p>“Is he in?” the cabman inquired, getting into the
elevator.</p>

<p>“You can go up and see.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>When the top floor was reached the elevator boy
pointed out Rich’s room.</p>

<p>The cabman hurried up and knocked on the door.</p>

<p>Carter walked leisurely down the hall. He halted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
halfway down and looked out of the window. He
stood in such a position that he was able to see the
cabby.</p>

<p>Three times the driver pounded on the door without
receiving a response.</p>

<p>The fourth time he knocked as if he were going to
break in a panel.</p>

<p>Some one opened the door.</p>

<p>Carter could not see who it was from where he
was standing, but he heard the cabman exclaim:</p>

<p>“I want to see Mr. Simeon Rich.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t in,” a female voice replied.</p>

<p>Carter did not recognize it, but he surmised that it
belonged to either Sally Rich or Isabella Porter.</p>

<p>“I want to see him, miss,” the cabby insolently said.
“If he isn’t in I’ll wait until he comes.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” the woman within the room asked.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter who I am.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t, eh? Well, I guess it does.”</p>

<p>“Is Rich in there? If he is, tell him that the cabman
who drove him about town on the day before
New Year’s wants to see him.”</p>

<p>“Let him come in,” a man’s voice called out from
the interior of the room.</p>

<p>The coachman pushed by the woman and entered
the apartment.</p>

<p>Instantly the door was closed.</p>

<p>Carter hurried up to the door.</p>

<p>A transom was above it.</p>

<p>It was halfway open.</p>

<p>Reaching up, Carter caught hold of the edge of
the sill under the transom and pulled himself up until
he was able to peer into the room. He beheld Rich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
and Darwin seated on divans at the side, and two
women lolling back in steamer chairs. The cabman
was standing in the center of the apartment gazing
boldly at Rich.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” Rich demanded, in a stern
tone, as he glared at the cabby.</p>

<p>“Do you want me to talk out before these people?”
the cabby asked, looking around the room at those
present and waving his hand toward them.</p>

<p>“I have no secrets from them.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t, eh?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then you must all be in the same boat. This is
rich graft.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Rich uttered an oath and sprang up. He realized
that the cabby knew something. He was enough of a
student of human nature to read the man’s intentions
in the expression of his face.</p>

<p>The cabman did not flinch.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll come to time, Mr. Rich,” he insolently
remarked, with a sneer.</p>

<p>Rich stood within a few feet of him. He raised his
arm above his head, as if he intended to strike the
man, but thinking better of it, he allowed it to drop
to his side again, and he muttered an oath.</p>

<p>Cabby was no fool. He knew what was in Rich’s
mind.</p>

<p>“If you had tried to strike me then I’d have floored
you,” he growled. “And it is well for you that you
did not try it on.”</p>

<p>Rich made no reply. He only glared at the cabby
in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>His face was as dark as night.</p>

<p>Carter hung on to the sill. He had viewed the scene
through the transom, and he had heard every word
that had been uttered.</p>

<p>His arms were aching. He was forced to let go
his hold.</p>

<p>Without making a noise he dropped to the floor.</p>

<p>Now he stood outside the door and listened.</p>

<p>At last he heard Rich exclaim:</p>

<p>“Speak out, sir, and tell me how you learned my
name and address?”</p>

<p>“I’m not giving my friends away,” the cabby replied.</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Money.”</p>

<p>“Money!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“To keep my tongue from wagging.”</p>

<p>“I——”</p>

<p>“You understand me, Mr. Rich. The man whom
you tracked from the Grand Central on the day before
New Year’s was the man who was murdered at the
Red Dragon Inn.”</p>

<p>Carter had raised himself up again so that he was
peering through the transom when the cabman uttered
these words.</p>

<p>Rich did not start. He displayed not the least sign
of fear. He glanced at the man with a sinister expression
upon his darkly handsome face.</p>

<p>“I am aware of that,” he replied, in cold, harsh
tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“You are a good bluffer, Rich,” the cabby remarked,
and he smiled.</p>

<p>It was as good as looking at a play to watch these
two men.</p>

<p>Both now had their tempers under command.</p>

<p>“You call me a bluffer,” Rich retorted.</p>

<p>“I do,” cabby rejoined. “I am not afraid of you. I
will go to the police and inform them that you tracked
Lawrence on the day before New Year’s, and you
hired one of the worst thugs in the city to keep on his
trail. Carter would reward me liberally for this information.”</p>

<p>“You are a scoundrelly blackmailer.”</p>

<p>“I acknowledge the corn. I’ve got you in a corner
and you will have to pay——”</p>

<p>“Not one cent will I give you.”</p>

<p>“Think twice, Mr. Rich.”</p>

<p>“Be careful, Sim.”</p>

<p>It was one of the women who spoke. She had come
up to Rich’s side and laid her hand gently upon his
arm.</p>

<p>The man glanced at her and said:</p>

<p>“I know what I am about, Sally.”</p>

<p>Carter knew from this that the woman was Rich’s
sister. The other woman he surmised was Isabella
Porter.</p>

<p>A broad grin spread over the cabby’s face.</p>

<p>“Yes, be careful, Mr. Rich,” he sneered. He was
becoming more insolent the longer he waited.</p>

<p>Rich wheeled around. His large, black eyes were
flashing, his face was aflame with passion.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> be careful,” he hissed between his clenched,
white teeth, and he drew his arm back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>Sally threw herself between her brother and the
cabman.</p>

<p>“Sim,” she ejaculated, “calm yourself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, calm yourself, my covey,” cabby repeated with
a chuckle.</p>

<p>Rich bit the ends of his mustache and glared. He
was making a desperate effort to keep calm. A silence
followed.</p>

<p>Cabby kept his eyes on Rich.</p>

<p>When he saw that Simeon was not going to speak
he said:</p>

<p>“Let us get down to business, Rich. There is no
use of trying to bluff me. I’m too old a bird to stand
any kind of a jolly.</p>

<p>“I can read your character, and you ought to be able
to read mine.</p>

<p>“If I should go to the police with the information
which I possess, you know they would come down on
you heavily.”</p>

<p>“Wait one moment.”</p>

<p>“Let me finish.</p>

<p>“I have no desire to injure you if you treat me
halfway decently.</p>

<p>“Times have been very bad with me lately, and I
need money.</p>

<p>“I feel convinced that you and your friends have
gained by the death of old Lawrence.</p>

<p>“In to-day’s paper was published an account of the
Lawrence will case, and it was suggested that a search
be made for you and the wife and daughter of the
murdered man.</p>

<p>“The police do not know where you are.</p>

<p>“They have no evidence against you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“But I can furnish that evidence.</p>

<p>“Now, how much is it worth to you for me to keep
silent?”</p>

<p>The cabby spoke calmly and deliberately. Rich followed
him closely. He frowned, and his fingers
worked nervously, as if he were desiring to spring
upon the man and strangle him. He did not reply for
some moments. He looked around at Darwin and the
women.</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” was in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Pay,” Darwin said, alarmed.</p>

<p>Rich turned his eyes on the cabman.</p>

<p>“How much do you want?” he asked.</p>

<p>“One thousand dollars,” cabby coolly replied, without
changing an expression.</p>

<p>“Absurd!”</p>

<p>“No, it is not.”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“To keep me quiet one thousand dollars is a small
sum.”</p>

<p>“How do I know, if I do pay you this sum, that you
will not give me away, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I never go back on my word.”</p>

<p>“I will give you five hundred.”</p>

<p>“Not a cent less than a thousand.”</p>

<p>“I can’t give you any such sum as that to-day.”</p>

<p>“I won’t be hard on you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that. I’ll take part on account.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you one hundred.”</p>

<p>“Make it three.”</p>

<p>“I can’t, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take the century.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“Here it is.”</p>

<p>“Now, when will you pay the balance?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Shall I call here?”</p>

<p>“No; I will send the money to you.”</p>

<p>“At my stand?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What time?”</p>

<p>“Noon.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be on hand.”</p>

<p>“See that it is.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Pete McCree.”</p>

<p>“What is the number of your cab?”</p>

<p>“Number one hundred and forty-seven.”</p>

<p>Cabby started toward the door.</p>

<p>Before he turned around, Carter dropped. He ran
toward the elevator, which he reached before the door
of the room was opened.</p>

<p>While standing with his back turned he changed his
disguise.</p>

<p>Then he got into the elevator.</p>

<p>As soon as the detective reached the street he halted
near the entrance.</p>

<p>When McCree came out he walked up to him and
tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Hello!” McCree ejaculated.</p>

<p>“I’m on hand,” Carter remarked.</p>

<p>“So I see.”</p>

<p>“How much did you get?”</p>

<p>“Not much.”</p>

<p>“How much?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“One hundred bones.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you make him pay more?”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t produce to-day, but he will do so to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I get half.”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“You are square.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get this note changed.”</p>

<p>“I’ll change it.”</p>

<p>“Have you got fifty?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Here’s the century.”</p>

<p>Carter took the bill and handed the cabby back fifty
dollars.</p>

<p>“Now let me give you a piece of advice,” he said.</p>

<p>“What is it?” McCree asked.</p>

<p>“Keep out of risky places to-night and be on your
guard.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“You are dealing with desperate men.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that, pard.”</p>

<p>“Rich may employ some one to try and put you
out of the way.”</p>

<p>“You should have seen how he acted.”</p>

<p>“I can imagine what he said.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what kind of a game he and those
others are playing?”</p>

<p>“So would I.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get back to the stand. I’ll see you
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Carter shook hands with the rascally cabman, and
they separated. The detective hastened away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>Half an hour later he was ushered into the presence
of the cashier of the safe deposit company.</p>

<p>“Have you discovered a clew?” the cashier asked.</p>

<p>“I’ll reply to that question as soon as you have answered
a few queries which I am going to put to
you,” the detective said.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“You said that you gave Mr. Lawrence new bills.”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember the numbers?”</p>

<p>“I can tell you in a moment.”</p>

<p>The cashier walked over to a desk, picked up a slip
of paper, referred to it and said:</p>

<p>“They were from 177865B to 177870B.”</p>

<p>“Keno!” Carter shouted. He held in his hand the
note which Rich had given to the cabman. He was
looking at it when the cashier read the numbers.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” the cashier asked.</p>

<p>“Do you see this bill?” Carter said, as he held the
bill out for the cashier to inspect.</p>

<p>“Gracious! Captain, that note is numbered one
hundred and seventy-seven thousand eight hundred
and sixty-nine B! That is one of the bills which I
gave to Mr. Lawrence!”</p>

<p>“Will you swear to that?”</p>

<p>“I will. That is one of the bills.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>The two men were silent.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>TIGHTENING THE COILS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The cashier of the safe deposit company kept gazing
in silence at Carter with open-mouthed astonishment.</p>

<p>Nick’s countenance was illumined with an expression
of triumph. He held in his hand damaging evidence
against Simeon Rich.</p>

<p>If Rich were innocent of the murder, how was it
that he had in his possession one of the bills which
the cashier of the safe deposit company had paid to
the man who had been so cruelly murdered at the Red
Dragon Inn?</p>

<p>“This is a valuable clew,” the detective said, when
the silence was becoming oppressive.</p>

<p>“How did that bill come into your possession?” the
cashier asked.</p>

<p>“I think you can keep a secret?”</p>

<p>“I can.”</p>

<p>“Then I will tell you.”</p>

<p>Then Carter gave the cashier a short account of
the evidence which he had collected.</p>

<p>When the detective finished the cashier remarked:</p>

<p>“Captain, you are gradually weaving the coils
around Simeon Rich.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Carter replied, “I am weaving coils around
him, but I have no positive evidence that he committed
the crime.”</p>

<p>“That note?”</p>

<p>“Not positive. If he has others of the series in his
possession, then the coil will be stronger around him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“I understand. What move will you make next?”</p>

<p>“I cannot determine just now.”</p>

<p>Carter was elated over the discovery.</p>

<p>After leaving the cashier’s office he went direct to
the house on Fourth Street.</p>

<p>Here he found that Brockey was still a prisoner.</p>

<p>His young assistant was on guard.</p>

<p>“Brockey,” said the detective, as he stood in front
of the prisoner, “have you spent all the money that
Darwin gave you?”</p>

<p>“What’s that to you?” Brockey snarled, being in an
ugly mood.</p>

<p>And no wonder!</p>

<p>Who could blame him?</p>

<p>Brockey was by no means a stoic or a philosopher.
His was a nature which would brood on troubles.</p>

<p>There was bitter hatred and malice in every flash
of his eye. No love there, no appreciation of the detective’s
ability!</p>

<p>Carter gazed down into that dark countenance. He
read the man’s thoughts.</p>

<p>“If you have any of that money left,” Carter replied,
in a serious tone, “some of it may be bills which
were stolen from the murdered man.</p>

<p>“I have the numbers of those bills in my possession.”</p>

<p>Instantly the expression on Brockey’s face changed.</p>

<p>A look of terror came over it.</p>

<p>It had not occurred to him before that the money
might have belonged to the man who was killed at the
Red Dragon Inn.</p>

<p>“Do you understand?” Carter asked at length, when
Brockey made no reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“I understand,” the rascal said, with a gasp.</p>

<p>“If you should have one of those bills on you, and
if it should be identified as belonging to Lawrence,
then, if I were so inclined, I could fix the murder
on you.”</p>

<p>“You would not do that?”</p>

<p>“No, I would not.”</p>

<p>“I have some of the money.”</p>

<p>“Is it in your pocket?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Carter put his hand into Brockey’s trousers pocket
and pulled out a small roll of bills. He ran the money
over and found one of the series.</p>

<p>“This is one,” he remarked, holding the bill up for
Brockey to inspect.</p>

<p>“My God!” the rascal ejaculated.</p>

<p>“You will have to tell now in court how this came
into your possession.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell quick enough.”</p>

<p>“I guess you will.”</p>

<p>“Let me look at the number.”</p>

<p>“See?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>The rest of the money the detective gave to Brockey.</p>

<p>The bill he marked and put away in his pocketbook
with the others.</p>

<p>The evidence against Rich was stronger.</p>

<p>But still more evidence was needed before a case
could be proven.</p>

<p>Carter left the house.</p>

<p>Slowly he walked through to Broadway, and when
he reached that thoroughfare he halted on the corner
and reviewed the events of the past few days. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
forced to acknowledge in spite of himself that the evidence
against Simeon Rich was strong.</p>

<p>But still he was not satisfied.</p>

<p>Dora Ferris’ testimony and that of Lena Peters
would be damaging.</p>

<p>The testimony of the cashier, the cabman, and
Brockey would be sensational.</p>

<p>And the note which he had found in Darwin’s room
in Dora’s flat would tighten the coil.</p>

<p>But it was not enough.</p>

<p>“Every link in the chain of evidence must be complete,”
Carter muttered. What move ought he to
make?</p>

<p>“Should he close in on Rich and his pals and take
the chance of discovering the needed evidence against
them?”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t do that,” the detective muttered, as
this question flashed through his mind.</p>

<p>He turned and wended his way uptown.</p>

<p>It was seven o’clock when he halted in front of the
Studio Building.</p>

<p>Some force seemed to impel him to enter. He did
not go near the elevator; but he walked upstairs to the
top floor. He strolled along the hall and stopped in
front of the door of Rich’s room.</p>

<p>No light shone through the transom.</p>

<p>Were the conspirators out?</p>

<p>Carter knocked.</p>

<p>No one came to the door.</p>

<p>“They must have gone out,” he muttered.</p>

<p>At the same time he pulled a skeleton key out of his
pocket and inserted it in the lock of the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>Two quick turns of the key and the bolt of the lock
slipped back.</p>

<p>Carter entered the room, and struck a match.</p>

<p>As the flame flickered up, and after he had looked
around, he uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>Around him were all the evidences of hasty flight.</p>

<p>The birds had flown.</p>

<p>Carter lit the gas.</p>

<p>Then he was able to make an inspection.</p>

<p>A look of chagrin rested upon his face as his eyes
wandered around the room.</p>

<p>The furniture belonging to the room of the building
was not disturbed.</p>

<p>The floor was strewn with rubbish.</p>

<p>After the detective recovered from his surprise he
commenced to make a search of the apartment. He
rooted among the scraps of paper on the floor in the
hope that he would find something of value.</p>

<p>He made no discovery.</p>

<p>Every bureau drawer was gone through.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>At last Carter made a search of the two closets.</p>

<p>Result?</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>He stood in the center of the room thinking.</p>

<p>His eyes wandered around.</p>

<p>Was there any evidence in that room? He asked
the question over and over again.</p>

<p>He was confident that his search had been most
thorough. But had it been? Was there not some place
about that room which contained evidence, and which
had escaped the eagle eyes of the visitor?</p>

<p>Carter suddenly started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“The fireplace!” he ejaculated, and he sprang forward.</p>

<p>At that moment his eyes had fallen on some soot
which covered the carpet in front of the fireplace.</p>

<p>What did this indicate? He had not examined the
fireplace!</p>

<p>Down upon his knees he fell in front of the grate.</p>

<p>Up into the chimney he thrust his hand and arm.</p>

<p>The next instant he pulled out a large bundle.</p>

<p>A cloud of soot fell down, and the detective was
covered with it.</p>

<p>He paid no attention to it.</p>

<p>All of his thoughts were on that bundle, which he
carried over to the center of the room.</p>

<p>Slowly he unwound the wrapper.</p>

<p>Then a long ulster was disclosed.</p>

<p>Carter shook out the folds.</p>

<p>A black slouch hat and a false beard fell to the
floor.</p>

<p>Was it any wonder that the detective’s hands shook
as he gazed upon and held this evidence?</p>

<p>He examined the ulster.</p>

<p>Down the front were a number of dark stains.</p>

<p>Upon the right sleeve was a large dark splash as
large as a man’s hand.</p>

<p>“Blood!” Carter ejaculated, as he inspected these
stains.</p>

<p>He looked inside the ulster at the stamp on the
strap.</p>

<p>“Made by Delaney,” he read.</p>

<p>“This was made to order,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“For whom?”</p>

<p>That was the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“I’ll find out!” he ejaculated, after a moment’s
thought.</p>

<p>Down into the pockets of this ulster his hand was
shoved.</p>

<p>One after the other was turned inside out.</p>

<p>Not a scrap of paper could he find.</p>

<p>All the outside pockets had been gone through.</p>

<p>Then Carter turned his attention to those inside.</p>

<p>“Nothing!” he muttered.</p>

<p>It was disappointing.</p>

<p>But the detective was not downcast. He picked up
the slouch hat and the beard, and examined them.</p>

<p>Inside the beard was stamped the word Dazian.</p>

<p>“That’s the name of the costumer,” Carter muttered,
as he read that name.</p>

<p>There were no marks inside the hat.</p>

<p>The lining had been torn out.</p>

<p>The ulster and the hat the detective tied up in a
bundle, and the false beard he put into his pocket.</p>

<p>For a few minutes longer he remained in the room
searching, but he made no further discovery.</p>

<p>Taking the evidence under his arm, he left the apartment.</p>

<p>It was an important discovery. He felt sure that
he had in his possession the ulster worn by the murderer
when he committed the crime.</p>

<p>In going down in the elevator the detective questioned
the boy in charge.</p>

<p>The boy said that Rich and Darwin had moved out
just at dusk, and they did not say where they were
going.</p>

<p>Carter stopped at the office, and the clerk was not
able to give him any information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>When he left the Studio Building he was perfectly
calm. He did not seem to be disturbed about the sudden
departure of the men.</p>

<p>The thought that they might have left the city did
not enter his mind.</p>

<p>Carter crossed Broadway to the little park in front
of the bank building.</p>

<p>Here he moved about among the cabmen making
inquiries.</p>

<p>All claimed that they had not taken any fares from
the Studio Building.</p>

<p>From Greeley Square the detective walked across
to the opposite corner, where a solitary express wagon
was standing.</p>

<p>The man in charge was partly intoxicated.</p>

<p>“Did you cart away anything from the Studio
Building this evening?” Carter asked as he came up
to the man.</p>

<p>“You may bet I did,” the man blurted out in thick
tones. “I made a good stake.”</p>

<p>“They were nice men?”</p>

<p>“You may bet they were.”</p>

<p>“Where did you leave the things?”</p>

<p>“In a flat at number two hundred and forty-one
West Thirty-sixth Street.”</p>

<p>“What name?”</p>

<p>“Lawrence.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure that was the name?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am. The tall fellow wrote it down on
a slip of paper for me.”</p>

<p>“Was he at the flat to receive the things?”</p>

<p>“No. The two ladies were there, though.”</p>

<p>“Only the two ladies?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>“That was all.”</p>

<p>Carter did not go direct to the address on West
Thirty-sixth Street after he left the expressman. He
hurried down to Union Square and entered Dazian’s
musty-smelling establishment.</p>

<p>To the clerk in charge he showed the false beard.</p>

<p>“We made that,” the clerk said, after he had examined
the disguise.</p>

<p>“Do you remember selling a beard like that lately?”
the detective asked.</p>

<p>“I remember selling this.”</p>

<p>“You do?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“When did you sell it?”</p>

<p>“The morning of the day before New Year’s.”</p>

<p>“To whom did you sell it?”</p>

<p>“A tall man.”</p>

<p>“Did you sell him anything else?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“A Moorish dagger.”</p>

<p>“Anything else?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Did he give you his name?”</p>

<p>“No. He paid for the things and he took them away
with him.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a coat had he on?”</p>

<p>“An ulster.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a hat?”</p>

<p>“An old slouch.”</p>

<p>“Is this the color of the ulster?”</p>

<p>Carter untied the bundle while he was talking, and
now he displayed the ulster in front of the clerk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“It was that color,” the young man ejaculated. “And
that is the slouch hat. I remember noticing that the
rim was slightly torn.”</p>

<p>“Would you be able to identify that man?”</p>

<p>“I would.”</p>

<p>“Was he alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The detective next went to the tailoring establishment
conducted by Delaney. He showed the ulster to
the manager.</p>

<p>“We made that garment six years ago,” the manager
said, after he had inspected the coat.</p>

<p>“Can you tell for whom?” Carter asked. “If you
can tell me, I shall be greatly obliged.”</p>

<p>“I can. Do you notice this number in indelible ink
on the pocket flap? Well, that is the number of the
order. I will refer to our books.”</p>

<p>He walked back into the office and examined a
large ledger.</p>

<p>In a few moments he returned to Carter and said:</p>

<p>“That coat was made for a gentleman named Simeon
Rich.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Carter rejoined, and then he departed.</p>

<p>The coils around Rich were tightening, but the detective
had not found that weapon with which the
crime had been committed.</p>

<p>Perhaps the murderer had thrown it away.</p>

<p>That was likely.</p>

<p>That the weapon was a Moorish dagger and the
one purchased at Dazian’s the detective was convinced.</p>

<p>On a mere whim, Nick took all his evidence down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
to police headquarters and made a report to the chief
inspector.</p>

<p>When he was through the chief said:</p>

<p>“I will send out men to fetch in all the witnesses.</p>

<p>“We will assemble them here in this room, and
then, if we corral the conspirators, we will bring them
in. Mark my word. We will get a confession from
one of them.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make out a list of the witnesses.”</p>

<p>“Call them off and I’ll write them down.”</p>

<p>“The bartender at the Red Dragon Inn, Doctor
Thompson, Peter Wright, Brockey Gann, Lena Peters,
Lem Samson, Dora Ferris, Dazian’s clerk, the cashier
of the safe deposit company, Delaney’s manager, and
the cabman, number one hundred and forty-seven.”</p>

<p>“I’ll send out men for them.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Close in on Rich.”</p>

<p>“Do you need assistance?”</p>

<p>“Give me two men.”</p>

<p>The chief inspector called in two men and they
went out with Carter.</p>

<p>They entered a taxicab and were driven to the
address given to the detective by the expressman.</p>

<p>The name of Lawrence was on the letter box belonging
to the first flat.</p>

<p>Carter entered the hall with his men.</p>

<p>One of them he sent back to guard the back door
of the flat and prevent escape by that exit. Then he
knocked on the front door, which was opened by a
tall, comely, gray-haired woman.</p>

<p>Within he heard voices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“What do you want?” the woman asked, as Carter
and his aid shoved past her.</p>

<p>The detective made no reply. He and his companion
darted into the parlor.</p>

<p>Rich and Darwin and three women were there.</p>

<p>All sprang to their feet.</p>

<p>The women screamed.</p>

<p>Carter covered the men with his revolver and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Rich, there is no chance for you to escape. The
house is surrounded by my men. You may as well
submit quietly.”</p>

<p>“What does this intrusion mean?” Rich demanded.</p>

<p>“It means that I arrest you for the murder of Alfred
Lawrence, and these others”—looking around the
room at the others and pausing for a moment—“I
arrest them as your accomplices.”</p>

<p>In a short time the two men were manacled.</p>

<p>They offered no resistance, because they saw that
it would be of no avail.</p>

<p>The two detectives guarded the prisoners while
Carter made a search of the flat.</p>

<p>In a trunk belonging to Rich he found a Moorish
dagger, the blade and hilt of which were stained with
blood. He also found an old pocketbook with papers
belonging to the murdered man in it.</p>

<p>On this were marks of bloody fingers.</p>

<p>The woman who admitted Carter was the wife of
the murdered man, and the third woman in the parlor
was Lawrence’s daughter. She was a beautiful young
woman, but at a glance the detective saw that she had
been leading a life of dissipation.</p>

<p>The prisoners were taken to police headquarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>When Rich was led into the chief inspector’s office
and he beheld the witnesses congregated there all his
bravado fled.</p>

<p>“The game is up!” he ejaculated, and he sank into
a chair, his handsome face the color of death. “You
cornered me, Mr. Carter. I killed Lawrence. There
is no use for me to deny anything. When I learned
that he was about to be released from Sing Sing I
made up my mind to kill him. I feared him, and so
did his wife. I knew there was evidence in existence
to prove that we had conspired against him.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have received statements from all
these people and there is no use for me to make a long
confession.</p>

<p>“All I’ll say will be that I tracked Lawrence to the
Red Dragon Inn, and when the bartender’s back was
turned I slipped upstairs and hid in the parlor.</p>

<p>“Then I waited until the house was quiet, when I
stole up to Lawrence’s room and killed him.</p>

<p>“I escaped through the window and then down the
ladder to the back yard.</p>

<p>“I solemnly swear that Mrs. Lawrence and her
daughter had nothing to do with the crime.”</p>

<p>The mystery of the Red Dragon Inn was solved at
last, and when the newspapers published the facts in
regard to the work done by Carter a sensation was
created. Nick had little time to bask in the glow of
journalistic applause, even had he cared to do so. He
was soon plunged in the case to which his assistants
had been paving his way by their investigations.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>MURDER IN HELL’S KITCHEN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>To understand the preliminaries of the case on
which Chick Carter and Patsy had been working for
their chief, we must go back to a time before Simeon
Rich was tried and executed, before Darwin was sent
back to England, where he afterward died in prison.</p>

<p>To begin with, Old Mother Flintstone, well known
in the neighborhood of Hell’s Kitchen, was dead.</p>

<p>All people have to die, and the old woman had to
follow the written law of all mankind; but, what was
queer, her death was a subject for police investigation.</p>

<p>She had not lived the best of lives, this old hag,
toothless and decrepit in her hovel, where her couch
was rags and the walls grimy and almost black; she
had been a fence and what not, and there were stories
about her that made people even in that delectable
quarter of Gotham shake their heads over them.</p>

<p>She had died in the night.</p>

<p>Death had come to the hovel in the wee sma’ hours
of the darkness, when the great city was supposed to
sleep the sleep of the innocent and righteous; but somehow
or other there was a suspicion that a human hand
had helped Mother Flintstone out of the world.</p>

<p>She lived alone, but now and then she was visited
by a boy—a waif of the streets, little, but shrewd and
wiry.</p>

<p>Mulberry Billy, as the boy was called, had a story
to tell, and it was his narrative which had set the
police agog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>The boy had gone to Mother Flintstone’s just before
day, crawling into the old place, where he knew
there was always a bed for him, and had found the
old lady lying on her face on the floor.</p>

<p>Billy tried to lift the body and bear it to the couch
near by, but the lot of bones slid from his hands.</p>

<p>Then he saw the distorted face, the wide, staring
eyes and the clenched hands.</p>

<p>Then he saw that his old benefactress was past all
human aid, and he stood stock-still and thought how
kind she had been to him.</p>

<p>But this was not all Billy saw. He was attracted
to the right by a noise in the direction of the only
window in the room, and there he saw the outlines of
a face.</p>

<p>It was not a rough face, as one would expect to see
in that locality; it was not the face of a hardened
ruffian, seamed with sin and desperate. It was a finely
cut face, handsome, aristocratic, like those Billy sometimes
saw on Fifth Avenue or Broadway. It had good
eyes, white skin, a broad forehead, and well-chiseled
lips. The mustache did not entirely hide the latter, but
it did not let the boy get a good look at them.</p>

<p>If the face at the window had been wicked-looking
or desperate the boy would not have been astonished,
for he would have thought that the desperate murderer
had come back to see if the victim had yet been discovered.</p>

<p>Mother Flintstone was reputed rich; she was said
to have accumulated by her calling a good deal of
wealth, which she had concealed somewhere, but where
even Billy, her one little confidant, did not know.</p>

<p>The boy looked at the face till it seemed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
photographed on his mind. He would know it among
a thousand faces, he thought.</p>

<p>It should not escape him, and he would give a certain
person a full description of it.</p>

<p>In a moment, as it were, the face vanished.</p>

<p>Billy turned again to the dead woman, but looked
now and then toward the window. He saw that the
old woman had been killed, for the rent in her throat
told where the dagger had found her life and put an
end to her varied career.</p>

<p>As yet the murder was his secret and the murderer’s.</p>

<p>Mulberry Billy remained in the little room some
time, or until he had composed his nerves.</p>

<p>One does not discover a terrible crime every day,
not even in New York. He wanted to think the matter
over a little; he wanted to decide just what to do.</p>

<p>“I’ll see Patsy again, that’s best,” he said aloud,
though addressing himself. “Patsy Garvan once befriended
me, and he’ll tell Mr. Carter about this, and
I know Mr. Carter’s the man to take charge of this
matter and avenge Mother Flintstone.”</p>

<p>With this the street Arab slipped from the house and
went out upon the street again.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he ran up a flight of steps leading
to Nick’s downtown den, where he had captured
Brockey, and knocked at a door.</p>

<p>Footsteps crossed the room beyond and the door was
opened.</p>

<p>“You, boy! Come in.”</p>

<p>Billy entered, looking at the person who had opened
the door, and who now stood in the middle of the
room looking at him with a smile on his face. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
expected to find Chick Carter or Patsy there, and he
was surprised to meet the great detective himself already
on the trail once more.</p>

<p>“What’s happened, boy?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“They’ve got Mother Flintstone at last, sir.”</p>

<p>“Who have?”</p>

<p>“That’s for you to find out, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that the old lady’s dead, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Don’t I?”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“In the crib.”</p>

<p>“Do you know who saw her last?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; the man who did it.”</p>

<p>Carter smiled at the answer and took a seat at the
table.</p>

<p>“Give me the story,” he said.</p>

<p>Billy did so. He omitted nothing, but he dwelt a
long time on the face at the window.</p>

<p>The famous detective seemed to think that face an
important matter, and he made the boy describe it half
a dozen times.</p>

<p>Presently he arose and put on an overcoat, for the
night was cold, and perhaps he wanted to protect his
face with the ample collar.</p>

<p>The pair left the room together, and Billy piloted
the detective to the scene of the crime.</p>

<p>“You can go now,” said Carter, when he had taken
a survey of the apartment. “I will need you to-morrow,
Billy. Don’t go far. You can take my lounge if
you want a snooze till then.”</p>

<p>The urchin went away, leaving Carter in the hovel
where Mother Flintstone lay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Nick went over the old place with his keen eyes
and eager hands.</p>

<p>If he found anything that let some light upon the
mystery he did not divulge the secret, and just as day
was breaking over the spires of Gotham he came out
of the place and walked away.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the police knew of the crime,
and a sergeant took possession of the old woman’s
abode.</p>

<p>Hell’s Kitchen had a new sensation, and its inhabitants
stood about in groups and discussed it.</p>

<p>The sensation was too late for the morning papers,
but it would do for the afternoon journals; and as
Mother Flintstone was a noted character, half a dozen
reporters came to the scene with ready pencils and
reportorial noses.</p>

<p>The papers in the afternoon told all there was to tell.</p>

<p>They dished up the past life of the old woman and
colored it to suit themselves.</p>

<p>Some had her a woman once respected and wealthy,
the wayward daughter of a money king; others said
she was related to royalty; none put her down as plain
Mother Flintstone—that, you know, being the unvarnished
truth, would never do!</p>

<p>The wasted body was removed to the morgue and
the surgeons brought their skill to bear upon the case.
All agreed that the old creature had been foully killed
by a dagger, and the coroner’s jury added “by some
person unknown,” and then turned the matter over to
the police.</p>

<p>The following night Carter, alone in his room, heard
a rap on his door, and he opened it to look into the
face of a young woman. He held the door open and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
the girl—she was no more than this in years—glided
into the room.</p>

<p>“Lock the door, please,” she said, with an appealing
look at the detective.</p>

<p>Carter did so and turned to her.</p>

<p>His visitor had taken a chair, and in the light he
saw how frightened she was and how she trembled.</p>

<p>“You haven’t any clew yet?” was her first question.</p>

<p>“Clew to what?”</p>

<p>“Why, to the murderer of Mother Flintstone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re interested in that, are you?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought you’d want to know that and it’s
no more than right that I should tell you. You may
call me Margie Marne.”</p>

<p>“But that’s not your name.”</p>

<p>The girl smiled.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not; don’t, for Heaven’s sake, rob me of
the only secret I have—my true identity.”</p>

<p>“I will not. You shall keep your name. That
secret can belong to you as long as you want it, or
until you see best to disclose it.”</p>

<p>“The time may come when I can speak,” was the
reply. “But you haven’t answered my question yet.”</p>

<p>“About the clew? It’s a queer case.”</p>

<p>“And a dark one?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“No reward has been offered?”</p>

<p>“Not a dollar.”</p>

<p>“But you want to find out who killed Mother Flintstone,
and why.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“I do, and I will find out.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” cried Margie Marne, rising from
her chair and seizing Carter’s hands. “That’s the best
thing I ever heard a man say.”</p>

<p>“What was the old lady to you?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me. Only find the hand that slew her.”</p>

<p>“That’s my mission, as I’ve already told you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll reward you,” and she seemed to smile again.
“I don’t look like a person of wealth, but I can reward
the man who solves this mystery of the tenements.
I’m not as poor as I look, not a female Lazarus by
any means.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look it, either.”</p>

<p>The girl would have replied if footsteps had not
approached the detective’s door, and he crossed the
room.</p>

<p>Billy, the street Arab, bounded in the moment the
door was opened.</p>

<p>“I’ve located him!” he cried the moment he caught
sight of Carter. “I can show you the face I saw at
the window last night. Come! Let the gal stay. We
don’t want her. No gals in the case for Mulberry
Billy is my motto,” and the boy darted toward the
door again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>THE MILLIONAIRE’S GUEST.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>In another part of the city about the same time that
witnessed these events a scene was being enacted which
is destined to have an important bearing on Carter’s
present case of mystery.</p>

<p>This time it was not in the heart of that tough locality
called Hell’s Kitchen, but in the haunts of the
better classes, indeed, in what might be called the abode
of wealth.</p>

<p>Perry Lamont was a multimillionaire. He was a
man of past fifty, but with very few gray hairs and
a florid complexion. He was not engaged in any business,
having retired from the “Street” some years
prior to the opening of our story, and now was resting
at his ease.</p>

<p>Surrounded with wealth of every description, this
man was an envied person and a man to be congratulated
on the easy life he could lead in his luxurious
mansion.</p>

<p>Blessed with wife and children, the latter grown to
manhood and womanhood, he passed his days in luxury,
his only fad being fast horses, with which his
stables were filled.</p>

<p>Perry Lamont sat in the splendid library of his
home and smoked a prime cigar. He was alone. His
wife and daughter had gone to the opera and his son
was playing billiards at the club.</p>

<p>Therefore Lamont had the whole house to himself,
for it was the servants’ night off, and he had resolved
to take his ease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>Suddenly the clear tones of the bell reverberated
through the mansion, but the millionaire did not rise.
He did not want any visitors, and he was not at all
in the humor to be disturbed.</p>

<p>Again the bell rang, a little sharper than before, and
he laid down the cigar.</p>

<p>“Confound it all, why can’t a fellow get a little
rest?” he growled, crossing the room toward the hall.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity some people haven’t the slightest notion
about propriety, but must come when a man wants to
throw off the cares of the world and enjoy himself.”</p>

<p>For the third time the bell jangled, and the next
moment Lamont reached the door. He opened it with
a growl on his lips, but all at once a man rudely pushed
past him into the hall.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” said the stranger, who was tall
and decidedly good looking from what the millionaire
could see of his face, for he kept his collar up. “Don’t
think I’m an intruder. Of course, I came here on
business, and that overleaps every other consideration,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Business? This way, then.”</p>

<p>Lamont led the way to the library, where he waved
his caller to a chair.</p>

<p>“You have a son, I believe?” said the visitor.</p>

<p>“I have. I guess that’s no disgrace,” smiled Perry
Lamont, who was inordinately proud of his son and
heir.</p>

<p>“He’s at the club just now?”</p>

<p>“That’s his pleasure, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Is he your only son?”</p>

<p>“He is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“And you look to him to keep up the honor of the
house of Lamont?”</p>

<p>“He’ll do that, never fear, Claude will.”</p>

<p>“That is, he will if the law will let him.”</p>

<p>The nabob started.</p>

<p>“Have a care, sir!” he cried, coloring. “This is my
house, and a man’s house is his castle.”</p>

<p>“That’s old, but good,” grinned the unwelcome and
uncivil caller. “I’ve often wondered where that saying
originated, but never had time to look it up.”</p>

<p>Lamont looked at the man amazed, for he never
saw such coolness in all his life.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a daughter, too,” continued the
stranger.</p>

<p>“What’s that to you?”</p>

<p>“Not much, perhaps, but a good deal to you.”</p>

<p>“There you’re right; but you shall not make sport
of my child. My affection for her is too sacred for
that.”</p>

<p>“She’s pretty and good. I know her.”</p>

<p>“<i>You?</i>” almost roared the millionaire, falling back
in his chair and staring at the other. “This is carrying
a joke too far.”</p>

<p>“Just as you think; but let’s go back to Claude.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t have another thing to do with you.
You remember you are not an invited guest——”</p>

<p>“That’s right—not an invited guest, but I don’t
quit this house till I care to go.”</p>

<p>“By Jove——”</p>

<p>“Come, come, keep your temper.”</p>

<p>“You won’t let me,” said Lamont, with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>“Well, this boy of yours is a little wild. He’s the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
lion of the club, but he don’t always keep within the
bounds of the law.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to insinuate anything, only to remind
you that he is just now harvesting his crop of wild
oats.”</p>

<p>“Just as far too as many boys do.”</p>

<p>“But the yield is larger on some grounds than on
others.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean——”</p>

<p>“That your hopeful is reaping a gorgeous crop, eh?
That’s it precisely.”</p>

<p>“But he knows when to stop.”</p>

<p>“The sheriff will do that.”</p>

<p>Lamont started forward, and for the first time his
face became really pale.</p>

<p>“That’s an insult!”</p>

<p>“I thought you would consider it such.”</p>

<p>“It is infamous!”</p>

<p>“You’re good at words.”</p>

<p>“Come, this interview is at an end.”</p>

<p>“Not yet. What will you give to save your son?”</p>

<p>“To save him? He’s committed no crime yet——”</p>

<p>“Will you give ten thousand?”</p>

<p>“Not a dollar! If Claude has committed some little
indiscretion such as young men will——”</p>

<p>“He’s done more than that. It would be charity
to designate it by the name you have just mentioned,
but the authorities would call it something else.”</p>

<p>“Where is Claude?”</p>

<p>“At the club, just where you said he was.”</p>

<p>“Then——”</p>

<p>“I’ll take ten thousand and save the boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“From what?”</p>

<p>“The electric chair!”</p>

<p>Perry Lamont seemed to reel in his chair, and it was
with difficulty that he kept his seat.</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Just as you like. It’s all true, however.”</p>

<p>“It’s false, I say, as false as perdition! My boy
wouldn’t stoop to crime.”</p>

<p>“No; he’s an angel. And all he wants is a pair of
wings which would just fix him out.”</p>

<p>Lamont reddened and then turned pale again.</p>

<p>“I announce this interview terminated,” he said, but
his voice was agitated and his gaze wandered to the
door across the room.</p>

<p>“You can write out the check for the amount I have
mentioned if you have any regard for the honor of
your house.”</p>

<p>“Not a dollar!”</p>

<p>“Then take the consequences!”</p>

<p>So threatening, the man arose and coolly buttoned
his coat.</p>

<p>“You’re mad,” said the millionaire.</p>

<p>“Perhaps. I’m money mad, but I want to save you
and yours. I don’t want to heap disgrace upon your
wife and daughter. I don’t want to disgrace you and
see your boy go to the chair. I don’t want to do
anything of the kind, and I won’t if you pay me for
the secret.”</p>

<p>Perhaps something told Perry Lamont that he was
dealing with a desperate man, who, after all, might
have the secret he spoke of, but it was such a terrible
thing to think of that it chilled his blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“I’m a man of business. I want the check or your
boy is exposed.”</p>

<p>“What is the crime?” asked Lamont.</p>

<p>“What did I say? They take life for murder only.”</p>

<p>“My son!—a murderer!”</p>

<p>“They will certainly lay hands on Claude if you
don’t buy my silence.”</p>

<p>“In Satan’s name, who are you?”</p>

<p>“The man who knows!”</p>

<p>In the drawer before the millionaire lay a self-cocking
revolver, and this flashed through his mind as he
resolved upon desperate action.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, as nonchalantly as possible, and
in a second he had opened the drawer.</p>

<p>The man near by stood in such a position that he
could not look into the place, and he did not see Lamont’s
hand close about the black ivory stock of the
weapon.</p>

<p>Suddenly the millionaire’s hand leaped from the
drawer and the revolver flashed in the stranger’s face.</p>

<p>“I won’t be blackmailed,” hissed Lamont. “I’m as
merciless as a tiger when aroused, and I count your
life as nothing as compared to the welfare of my
family. What is the lie you have made up for to-night’s
work? What is the infamous story you have
planned about my son? Tell me or I will kill you
where you stand, and the world will lose your infamy
in this house.”</p>

<p>The man on the carpet seemed to increase an inch
in stature as he looked down into the tensely drawn
face of the man of many fortunes.</p>

<p>“You’d do that, would you?”</p>

<p>“As I live I will!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“You’re a fool, Perry Lamont.”</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“You might slay me here, but the net would be
played out or drawn in all the same. You don’t suppose
I would place myself in your power the sole custodian
of this secret which, if let out, will send your son to
the electric chair? I’m no fool.”</p>

<p>The tightly clutched weapon seemed about to fall
from Lamont’s hand.</p>

<p>“The secret is unloosed the moment I die at your
hands,” continued the cool stranger. “Come, treat me
white, and I’ll treat you the same. I want ten thousand
for what I know. It saves your boy and rescues your
house from disgrace.”</p>

<p>A singular cry welled from the millionaire’s throat,
the revolver slipped to the floor and he sank back in
the chair in a dead faint.</p>

<p>The stranger leaned forward and opened the drawer,
and seeing something there he transferred it to an
inner pocket.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>BACK TO THE RED SPOT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>When Carter and Mulberry Billy reached the street
at the foot of Carter’s stairs the boy pointed toward
a cab just driving away.</p>

<p>“He must be in that,” said Billy. “I saw him talking
to a man from the cab window just now——”</p>

<p>“The man whose face you saw at the window of
Mother Flintstone’s den, Billy?”</p>

<p>“The same bloke.”</p>

<p>The detective looked after the cab as it rounded a
corner and then turned again to the boy.</p>

<p>“But the man who was spoken to from the cab?”
queried the detective.</p>

<p>“He’s gone, too.”</p>

<p>In another instant there stepped from a doorway a
few steps distant a man at whom the boy pointed excitedly.</p>

<p>“That’s him, Mr. Carter!” he exclaimed, as the man
thus singled out coolly lit a cigar.</p>

<p>Carter eyed him for a moment and then looked
away.</p>

<p>The fellow walked off and the boy of the street
watched him with much curiosity.</p>

<p>“Could you keep him in sight for me, Billy?” asked
the detective.</p>

<p>“Just as if I’d lose him on purpose!”</p>

<p>Billy hurried away and watched the smoker with
all the keenness he could bring to bear upon the matter.</p>

<p>For some time the boy was led a merry chase, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
the man at first seemed to suspect that he was watched,
but at last he appeared to think that he had baffled the
young shadower, for he became bold and sauntered
along at his ease.</p>

<p>Billy saw him walk up the steps of a noted clubhouse,
and then stepped back to wait for his reappearance.</p>

<p>For this purpose the boy stationed himself in a
doorway near at hand.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and while many came out of the
club this particular one did not, and the street Arab
grew a little impatient.</p>

<p>“Seems to me he’s going ter roost there,” said Billy
to himself. “I’m booked for this doorway all night if
he does, for I intend to keep my agreement with Mr.
Carter—to watch that man till doomsday.”</p>

<p>All at once there sounded above the boy footsteps
on the stairs, and as he looked around he was pounced
upon eaglelike by a hand that seemed to sink into his
bones.</p>

<p>“Ouch!” cried the boy, as he drew back.</p>

<p>“Not a chirp, you young imp,” hissed a voice, as he
was pulled up over the steps.</p>

<p>Billy, of Mulberry Street, was dragged up the stairs
and down a long corridor, after which he was pulled
into a room by his tormentor. He heard the door
locked behind him, and then the gas was quickly turned
on. Then he was jammed roughly into a chair, after
which he got a look at the man who had caught him.</p>

<p>It was not the man he had watched, but quite another
person, and Billy wondered why he had caught
him.</p>

<p>“Spying, weren’t you?” said the man coolly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“Who are you?” demanded Billy. “And don’t you
know you’ve no right to treat me this way?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t, eh? Just wait till I’m through with you
before you crow that way.”</p>

<p>Then the man came forward and bent over Billy,
who shrank into the depths of the chair.</p>

<p>“Who sent you after me?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>“No falsehood! He did, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Whom do you mean?”</p>

<p>“You know.”</p>

<p>“You must explain.”</p>

<p>“Just as if you didn’t know anything, you little
gutter rat! To be plain, the man you were talking
to to-night told you to dog my steps. I know that
much.”</p>

<p>“Then that keeps me from explainin’,” smiled Billy,
whereat the man’s face grew dark.</p>

<p>“No insolence! Little chicks get their necks wrung
same as old ones.”</p>

<p>Billy leaped from the chair and sprang forward, but
he was arrested by the hand of the fellow and held
fast.</p>

<p>“Tell me the truth. He sent you after me?”</p>

<p>For once in his life at least Mulberry Billy was
terrified.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said.</p>

<p>“Nick Carter they call him, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Detective!”</p>

<p>The boy said nothing.</p>

<p>“Why am I to be watched?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“What has happened lately?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know? Don’t you ever read the papers?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Then you must know that they’ve killed Mother
Flintstone.”</p>

<p>“Who’s she?”</p>

<p>“My best friend, even if she didn’t have all the
frills of society,” said Billy, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Where did she live?”</p>

<p>“In Hell’s Kitchen.”</p>

<p>“That’s a nice name!”</p>

<p>“It fits the place.”</p>

<p>“What was Mother Flintstone?”</p>

<p>“She fenced some times.”</p>

<p>“Oho!” The exclamation was followed by a prolonged
whistle. “I see.”</p>

<p>The man, dropping Billy suddenly, took several
turns about the room.</p>

<p>“Could you show me where she lived, boy?” he suddenly
asked, coming back to the boy.</p>

<p>“I could——”</p>

<p>“And you will? That’s good! Mother Flintstone,
eh? Was that her right name?”</p>

<p>“Never heard any other for the old woman.”</p>

<p>The countenance of the stranger seemed to soften
and he told the boy to guide him.</p>

<p>They left the house together, the boy in advance,
and Billy piloted the man into Mulberry Bend and
straight to Hell’s Kitchen.</p>

<p>“It’s a tough place, I see,” was all the comment the
stranger made as they entered the locality.</p>

<p>“No place tougher, but I’ve called it home for a
long time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>Into the little old room—the place of sin and crime—Billy
led the man and a light was struck.</p>

<p>“Where did she keep her valuables?” asked the
man.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“But she had papers, hadn’t she?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say; but if she had the perlice must have
found them.”</p>

<p>“They searched the den, eh?”</p>

<p>“They looked it over.”</p>

<p>“Did Carter do it, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What did he find?”</p>

<p>The boy shook his head.</p>

<p>“You’re not the custodian of his secrets, I see.”</p>

<p>“I’m not.”</p>

<p>“Let me see what I can find.”</p>

<p>The man began to go through the place, watched
by the boy with all eyes. He was a good-looking fellow,
only his beard seemed a little too black and glossy
to be natural, and the boy had an idea that it had
never grown on his face.</p>

<p>All at once the man turned and looked at Billy.</p>

<p>At the same time he put out one hand, and it fell
upon a dusty shelf on one side of the room.</p>

<p>“Turn your back a moment, boy,” he commanded.</p>

<p>Billy did so, and while he looked away he was certain
that the stranger did something.</p>

<p>When again he looked around the man was standing
at his ease and his face was as calm as ever.</p>

<p>“Look yonder,” suddenly cried the boy, pointing at
the window. “There it is again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>The stranger turned in an instant, and then looked
at the street Arab.</p>

<p>“I see nothing at the window,” he said.</p>

<p>“It’s gone now. That’s the second time I saw it
there.”</p>

<p>“A face, was it, boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes; the face of the man who killed Mother Flintstone!”</p>

<p>“Then it’s not far off.”</p>

<p>With this the stranger ran out of the place, and
Billy heard him in the narrow court beyond.</p>

<p>“In the name of Satan, who is he?” ejaculated the
boy, while he waited for the man’s return.</p>

<p>His question was followed by a sharp report, and
in a second the boy was outside.</p>

<p>He smelled powder the moment he opened the door,
and then a human figure fell at his feet.</p>

<p>Billy sprang back with a cry and heard a half-suppressed
oath and flying footsteps.</p>

<p>“Say, boy,” said a voice, as the little fellow stooped
over a prostrate man on the bricks.</p>

<p>“Did you see him?”</p>

<p>“Only a glimpse.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s got me—just as I expected. But he
didn’t get the documents.”</p>

<p>“What documents?”</p>

<p>“Mother Flintstone’s. They’re here.”</p>

<p>The wounded speaker laid one hand on his left
breast. He tried to rise, but sank again to the stones,
and Billy could only look on, white-faced and breathless.</p>

<p>“You want a doctor and the perlice,” he said at
last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“Neither one,” growled the man through set teeth.
“I don’t want them, I say. I’m not dead yet, though
they gave me a close call to-night. Help me up. There,
you see I can stand all right. I feel better already.
I’m worth ten dead men, and in an hour I’ll be worth
fifty. Come, let us get out of this.”</p>

<p>Billy was not loath to go, and they glided from
the scene and struck the street in a few seconds.</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar!” cried the boy, falling back from the
man the moment he got a glimpse of him in the lamplight.
“Be you the devil or Tom Walker——”</p>

<p>The man stopped the boy by throwing his hand to
his face.</p>

<p>The black beard was gone and the skin was smooth,
and this was what had called forth the street urchin’s
exclamation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>THE FATE OF A SPY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Under the ground at last Mother Flintstone passed
from the minds of many. The hovel she had occupied
in Hell’s Kitchen got other tenants and the crime was
forgotten.</p>

<p>Not by everybody, however, for in the mind of more
than one person the old woman whose life no one
seemed to know beyond a few years was of some importance.</p>

<p>Carter was on the trail, and he was destined to find
it one of the strangest if not the most exciting of his
varied career. Nick had just learned that Brockey
Gann had been sent to Sing Sing for a short term, and
that Mrs. Lawrence and her daughter had gone abroad,
never to return to this country.</p>

<p>It was the night after his last adventure—the one
on the street with Billy, of Mulberry Street—when the
boy failed to point out the man he had seen, that he
stood in another part of the city.</p>

<p>The famous detective was quite alone, and his gaze
was riveted upon a man who stood in front of a
swell café lighting a cigar.</p>

<p>This person was well dressed and looked as if he
belonged to uppertendom.</p>

<p>His features were regular, though they showed some
signs of fashionable dissipation, and he carried a cane
with an elaborate gold head.</p>

<p>In short, this person was Claude Lamont, the son
of the millionaire, who had lately received the man
who wanted ten thousand dollars to keep a secret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>Lamont was a favorite at the club because he spent
his father’s money freely, and at times gave swell suppers,
which were the talk of the town.</p>

<p>Young Lamont appeared to be waiting for some
one, and presently that individual came out of the
café. He looked a good deal like Claude, only he
seemed to be several years his junior, and when the
two met they walked away together.</p>

<p>Carter followed.</p>

<p>The men were talking earnestly, and at last Carter
heard Lamont say:</p>

<p>“You didn’t make it with the governor, eh?”</p>

<p>“No; confound it all. He fainted just when I
thought I had landed the fish, and I came away with
an empty hook.”</p>

<p>“That’s bad.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t have been worse.”</p>

<p>“Shall I try again?”</p>

<p>“No, we must take another tack,” and then Claude
laughed.</p>

<p>This was all the detective heard, and the pair walked
a little faster.</p>

<p>After a while Carter let them go and turned his
attention to another part of the town.</p>

<p>This time he pushed his way into an upper room
in one of the most disreputable localities and confronted
a man who nearly leaped from a chair at sight
of him.</p>

<p>“Never mind. Don’t get excited, Jack,” smiled the
detective. “I’m not after you this time.”</p>

<p>The fellow, who was past thirty, with a slim face
covered with a beard of a week’s growth, seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
pleased, but at the same time he snarled like a wild
beast.</p>

<p>“I’ve got work for you,” said the detective.</p>

<p>“Not for me, no, sir! I won’t do any man’s work—not
even yours,” he growled.</p>

<p>“Come, Jack. It won’t get you into trouble.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, there!”</p>

<p>The speaker settled back into his chair and looked
ugly.</p>

<p>“You remember Mother Flintstone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I know she’s dead.”</p>

<p>“And buried.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, but I don’t care what they’ve done with
her. I am out of the business.”</p>

<p>“You know Claude Lamont?”</p>

<p>“The money king’s son? Of course I do, and I
know nothing very good of him, either.”</p>

<p>“Well, Jack, I want you to get on with him.”</p>

<p>“I say no.”</p>

<p>The voice was determined, but this fact did not
check the detective.</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Not if you want to make a sleuth out of me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t—in a sense.”</p>

<p>“But you want me to get in with this young lion and
get the worst of the bargain.”</p>

<p>Carter thought a moment.</p>

<p>Was there not some other way of bringing this man
to time?</p>

<p>Nick had befriended him once, had saved him from
a term up the river; and now he needed him.</p>

<p>Jack Redmond was a clever, all-around crook, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
at the same time, he knew how to spy and do anything
that required wits and cunning.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nick turned again to the man and said:</p>

<p>“You know Margie?”</p>

<p>At this Redmond started and seemed to shiver.</p>

<p>“Where is she?” he eagerly inquired.</p>

<p>“Where she can be found at any time.”</p>

<p>“Do you know?”</p>

<p>“Will you help me?”</p>

<p>Redmond sprang up and confronted the detective
with a quick look.</p>

<p>“Does she think of me yet?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say that.”</p>

<p>“Will you help me with Margie?”</p>

<p>“So far as I can.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m yours!”</p>

<p>For a moment the detective watched the man and
held out his hand; but the crook refused it.</p>

<p>“No, I’m yours. You’ve bought me,” he said.
“Now, what am I to do?”</p>

<p>For some time the detective talked, and was not
interrupted.</p>

<p>When he went away he seemed to smile to himself,
and half an hour later he was back in his own rooms.</p>

<p>One hour later Claude Lamont was met in the club
annex by a man, who held out his hand.</p>

<p>Lamont looked searchingly at this person and shook
his head.</p>

<p>“You have the best of me,” said he.</p>

<p>“What, don’t you know me?” cried the other, as if
surprised. “I’m Belmont.”</p>

<p>“The devil you are!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“That’s who I am, and I’m not surprised that you
did not recognize me.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were dead—in fact, three years ago
I read about your death at sea.”</p>

<p>“So did thousands,” laughed the so-called Belmont,
who was Jack Redmond, the crook. “I thought at one
time I was on the brink of eternity. We had nine
tough weeks on a tropical island, but were saved by
a liner.”</p>

<p>This seemed to satisfy Lamont, for he fell to talking
to Redmond, and the two adjourned to the wine-room
and opened several bottles.</p>

<p>It was midnight before they parted, and then Redmond
slunk away.</p>

<p>He had broken the ice.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” said he, “I will go a little further,
and before the week’s out I’ll have my clutches on this
man for Carter. He doesn’t suspect, and I’ve completely
hoodwinked him.”</p>

<p>Jack went back to his little den, but did not lock the
door.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he heard footsteps on the stair,
and, thinking that Carter was coming back, he watched
the door with some curiosity.</p>

<p>When the door opened he got pale, for instead of the
detective another man stood before him.</p>

<p>“Spy and informer, your time has come!” cried this
person, who seemed as wiry as a tiger as he crossed
the room.</p>

<p>Jack Redmond started from his chair, but a revolver
was thrust into his face, and he fell back.</p>

<p>“Silence! Not a word! That was a cool game you
played to-night,” continued the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“What game?” stammered the crook.</p>

<p>“You know, and it’s going to cost you your treacherous
life.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I say—your life!”</p>

<p>Jack looked into the muzzle of the weapon and wondered
if he could cross the space between them and
seize the man before he could press the trigger.</p>

<p>“You told a plausible tale, and he believed you.
You passed yourself off as Belmont, who lies in fifty
fathoms of water, and he took it all for gospel. You’ve
got to die.”</p>

<p>The crook said nothing.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” commanded the stranger.</p>

<p>Involuntarily Jack sat down and awaited the fellow’s
next movement.</p>

<p>“What have you to say before you die? Any word
to send to any person?”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to take my life?”</p>

<p>“I do. It isn’t worth the snuffing of a candle just
now. All the money in the world could not save you.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack was pounced upon by the human wolf
and crushed deeper into the chair.</p>

<p>A pair of demon hands seemed to meet behind his
windpipe, and he tried, but vainly, to rise.</p>

<p>His eyes bulged from his head, his tongue protruded
and he emitted a groan.</p>

<p>Three minutes later the demon arose and looked
down at the dark face in the chair.</p>

<p>Then he went through the crook’s pockets and found
nothing of value even to him.</p>

<p>Behind Jack was a wall tolerably white, and the
murderer went toward it. He took a pencil from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
pocket and wrote in scrawling characters across the
surface a few words that seemed to please him.</p>

<p>“That’s it. He’ll see it,” he hissed. “And he’ll know
that it is a death trail if he persists.”</p>

<p>In another moment the little den was tenanted by
no one but the silent man in the chair.</p>

<p>The gas burned over his head, sicklylike and blue,
and the room seemed filled with a noxious odor.</p>

<p>It burned on till the first streaks of morning revealed
the city, and pedestrians reappeared on the sidewalks.</p>

<p>No one came.</p>

<p>Several hours passed and the streets swarmed again
with their eager thousands.</p>

<p>Then the door was opened and Carter came in.</p>

<p>He stood stock-still at sight of the dead man—his
spy—in the chair, and then he happened to glance at
the wall.</p>

<p>In another second he was there, and his bulging eyes
had read:</p>

<p>“The spy first, the master next! There is no escape
for him!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<small>THE KNOCK-OUT DROPS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The man of many trails read the inscription on the
wall more than once before he turned away.</p>

<p>It meant him.</p>

<p>There was not the least doubt of this, and for some
time the detective stood rooted to the spot, as it were,
and looked at what appeared to be a record of doom.</p>

<p>At last he went over to the dead man in the chair,
and, lifting the body, he knew what had terminated
Jack Redmond’s career.</p>

<p>The hands of some fiend had strangled him, and
Nick seemed to inspect the marks on the throat for
the time that had elapsed since the tragedy.</p>

<p>Slowly and with deliberation the detective quitted
the scene of crime and went down the steps.</p>

<p>At the bottom he nearly ran against a woman with
a black shawl pulled over her head in such a manner
as to conceal her features. She tried to escape the
detective, but the detective’s hand shot out and drew
her toward him.</p>

<p>With the other hand he removed the shawl and
looked into a wan face seamed with want and dissipation.</p>

<p>“You know Jack?” he said.</p>

<p>“Heavens! Jack! Yes.”</p>

<p>“Will you go up and see him?”</p>

<p>She fell back, but the hand stayed her.</p>

<p>“He did it, then?” she cried.</p>

<p>“You saw some one, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“Yes; but for Heaven’s sake don’t mix me up in
anything like murder.”</p>

<p>Carter watched the nervous twitching of the
woman’s lips and waited for her to calm herself.</p>

<p>“When was he here?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Last night.”</p>

<p>“What was he like?”</p>

<p>“He was rather tall, and had a step as stealthy as a
tiger’s.”</p>

<p>“You saw him come?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And go?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“How long was the man upstairs?”</p>

<p>“Not over twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>“Did you suspect a crime?”</p>

<p>“I did; but I hadn’t the nerve to go up after he
went away. I only guessed his mission.”</p>

<p>Nick at last released the creature, who had in the
meantime called herself Gutter Nan for identification,
and went away.</p>

<p>“It’s the second crime,” was all the remark he made
to himself.</p>

<p>The detective sent word to police headquarters, and
as the crime, like the murder of Mother Flintstone,
came too late for the morning papers, the afternoon
journals got it.</p>

<p>No one knew among the reporters that Jack Redmond
had been Carter’s spy.</p>

<p>None was told who was meant by “the master” in
the sentence on the wall; they only guessed at that,
and some queer guesses they made, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>Carter found Margie Marne that same day, and the
girl’s first question was about his trail.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a strange letter here,” said the girl, handing
the detective a note she had just received.</p>

<p>The detective drew it from the envelope and read
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Miss Marne</span>: If you want to hear of something
to your advantage please come to the Trocadero to-day
at two and enter the first stall on the right. Come
alone, for this is business of importance, and greatly
concerns you.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Business.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>After reading the message the detective looked up
and found the eyes of the girl riveted upon his face.</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Shall I go?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do anything you tell me to,” was the reply, and
a faint smile flitted across the girl’s face.</p>

<p>“Have you fears, Margie?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I fear all the time ever since the death of
Mother Flintstone.”</p>

<p>“Who, think you, is ‘Business’?”</p>

<p>“An enemy.”</p>

<p>“Then, why go to the Trocadero?”</p>

<p>“Because you say so.”</p>

<p>Carter promised the girl that he would not be far
off at the hour mentioned in the letter, and Margie
agreed to be on hand. He did not see fit to tell her
about Jack Redmond’s death, as it might unnerve her,
and, bidding her good-by, he left the house.</p>

<p>It was near two that afternoon when a man, who
would not have been taken for Nick, entered the Trocadero<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
on the Bowery, and seating himself at a table
called for a drink.</p>

<p>The place was not very well filled at the time, and
while he sipped his wine the detective looked around
the place.</p>

<p>Presently he saw a man enter and go straight to the
stall designated by the letter to Margie, and the door
was closed behind him.</p>

<p>Now Carter began to wait for the girl, and ten
minutes later she came in.</p>

<p>Glancing up and down the place as if looking for
him Carter saw her enter the same stall and heard a
slight ejaculation when she found it occupied.</p>

<p>Just then the detective moved his seat to a table
nearer the stall and indulged again.</p>

<p>After drinking a third glass a strange feeling of
drowsiness seemed to take possession of him, and he
tried to shake it off.</p>

<p>In vain, however, did he battle against the feeling,
it only grew stronger, till at last he became aware
that he was sinking into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>His last recollection was of trying to rise and then
sinking down upon the chair, while everything became
black about him.</p>

<p>When the detective came to, a singular feeling
racked his head and he felt dizzy.</p>

<p>With some effort he managed to stagger to his feet
and then he went to the suspected stall.</p>

<p>The door now stood slightly ajar, and he pushed it
open, but the place was empty.</p>

<p>Where was Margie, and what had taken place in
that secluded spot where perhaps more than one crime
had been committed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>After looking at the table and taking in the whole
stall the detective shut the door and started toward
the walk.</p>

<p>He knew the fame of the Trocadero.</p>

<p>More than once a trail had led him across its precincts,
and on several occasions he had picked up important
clews under its roof.</p>

<p>But now he himself was the victim of trickery, the
dupe of crime, for he doubted not that the drinks had
been drugged by some infamous hand and for a purpose.</p>

<p>Behind the bar stood the man who had carried the
drinks to him, a little man with one of the worst faces,
and the detective thought he looked at him with wonderment
as if surprised that he—Carter—had escaped
death.</p>

<p>Fixing his eyes upon this man he leaned over the
bar and said:</p>

<p>“What became of the girl?”</p>

<p>The little wretch only grinned and turned away
to wait on a new customer.</p>

<p>But he was not to get rid of the champion detective
so easily, for the hand of Carter darted over the
counter and fastened on him like the talons of a vulture.</p>

<p>In Nick’s grip the man was a babe, and as the hand
seemed to sink to his bones he emitted a whimper that
sounded like a whine and looked blankly into the detective’s
face.</p>

<p>“I—I never saw the girl,” he cried.</p>

<p>“No lies, sir. I want the truth. Who told you to
drug me?”</p>

<p>“No one. I—I drug nobody. I’m honest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“So is Satan,” hissed the detective, and just then
the little wretch appealed to the owner of the establishment
for protection.</p>

<p>“No interference, Number Six,” said the detective,
with a look at the broad-shouldered owner of the Trocadero,
and the man thus designated winced.</p>

<p>“Tell the gentleman the truth, Caddy,” he said to the
little man; but that person was still stubborn.</p>

<p>“Caddy” hoped to be released without being forced
to tell the truth, but the detective had no idea of doing
this.</p>

<p>He actually pulled Caddy over the counter, to the
amusement of the few people in the place at the time,
and, putting his ear close to the barkeeper’s, he said:</p>

<p>“The truth or Sing Sing. Take your choice!”</p>

<p>This seemed to have a wonderful effect at once.</p>

<p>The detective escorted Caddy down the sawdusted
aisle and pushed him into the first stall.</p>

<p>“Where did they go?” he asked.</p>

<p>Caddy was very meek now, and his voice trembled
as he spoke.</p>

<p>“They went out the back entrance,” he said.</p>

<p>“Both of them?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How was the girl?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Did she seem to go willingly with the man?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think she did.”</p>

<p>“Was there a cab in the alley out there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>For a moment Carter looked daggers at the little
scoundrel, his indignation fast rising, but he kept his
temper as he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“You were that man’s agent. You fixed my drinks
at his suggestion or command.”</p>

<p>“He paid me for it.”</p>

<p>“But how did he designate me?”</p>

<p>“He told me to fix the gentleman at a certain table—that’s
all I know.”</p>

<p>“Look here! You’ve played a cool hand for a great
villain, and if anything happens to the girl I’ll hold
you, in part, responsible. Who was the man?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“You do know,” cried Carter, and again his hand
fell upon Caddy’s shoulder. “You didn’t do all this
for a total stranger. They don’t do such things in the
Trocadero. You know that man! Now who was he?”</p>

<p>The little man could not avoid the sharp eyes of the
best detective in New York, and he felt the hand on
his shoulder grow more viselike as the question was
put.</p>

<p>“Tell me. That or Sing Sing!” said Carter.</p>

<p>“He’s a rich bloke’s son,” answered Caddy.</p>

<p>“That’s not enough. Who is he? You know!”</p>

<p>“They call him Claude Lamont.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX.<br />

<small>AN INCORRUPTIBLE DETECTIVE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Ha, ha,” laughed Nick to himself. “So Mr. Lamont
is playing a nice little hand. We’ll see about it,”
and then he turned his attention again to the man he
had in tow.</p>

<p>“He told you to dose me, did he?”</p>

<p>Caddy nodded.</p>

<p>“Did he say why?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But he was anxious to have me drugged?”</p>

<p>“He seemed so.”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t you know where he took the girl?”</p>

<p>The little barkeeper of the Trocadero shook his
head in a solemn manner, and Carter felt that he was
in earnest.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t been back since?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The detective went to the back entrance of the place
and saw where a cab had stood.</p>

<p>Beyond doubt this was the vehicle in which Margie
Marne had disappeared with Claude Lamont, and after
looking the ground over without finding an additional
clew, Carter went back.</p>

<p>It might be hard to track the cab, as there were
hundreds in the city, and under the influence of
Claude’s money the drivers would not like to betray
a good customer.</p>

<p>The detective put this and that together, and in a
short time he might have been seen on the front steps
of the Lamont mansion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>It was his first visit to the place, and he did not
disguise himself in the least.</p>

<p>It was not a very fashionable hour for a call, but
his ring caused the door to open and he was ushered
in by a wondering maid.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Lamont in?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but he is indisposed.”</p>

<p>Sick or well, the detective had come to see the millionaire,
and he was not to be cheated out of his
game.</p>

<p>Handing the servant his card he waited in the hall,
and presently she came back asking him to step into
the library.</p>

<p>This the detective did, and in a few moments he
stood face to face with Lamont.</p>

<p>He had seen the nabob on several occasions, but he
seemed to have greatly aged in a short time and his
face looked haggard and pale.</p>

<p>Lamont looked up at his visitor and tried to place
him, but failed.</p>

<p>“I don’t know you,” said he, glancing down at the
detective’s card, which he held in his hand.</p>

<p>Carter, who had taken a chair opposite the man,
said in his peculiar tones:</p>

<p>“I am a detective. I have come here on a matter
of business which may concern you.”</p>

<p>“I am at a loss to know how.”</p>

<p>“In the first place, sir, are we alone?”</p>

<p>“Entirely so.”</p>

<p>The detective, in spite of this assurance, lowered his
voice.</p>

<p>“Whatever became of your sister, Mr. Lamont?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>There was a quick start, and the face of the millionaire
got white.</p>

<p>“I never had a sister,” said he, with an effort.</p>

<p>“Make sure of that. Whatever became of her, I
ask?”</p>

<p>Lamont looked around the room like a wild beast
seeking a loophole of escape, but seeing none he came
back to the detective.</p>

<p>“Pardon me for trying to deceive you,” said he.
“That is the black spot on our family history. I had
a sister once. But she is dead now.”</p>

<p>“Her name was——”</p>

<p>“Hester.”</p>

<p>“And you say she is dead?”</p>

<p>“She is.”</p>

<p>“When did her death take place?”</p>

<p>“Some twenty years ago.”</p>

<p>A faint smile came to the detective’s face, and for
half a second he looked searchingly into Lamont’s.</p>

<p>“Why try to deceive me?” he said. “You know
that this sister died within the last few days.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” and the millionaire almost started
from his chair, while his hands clutched the sides of
it like a madman.</p>

<p>“She died by violence,” coolly continued the detective.
“She was murdered—not for her money, for
she hadn’t much. But she was killed all the same.”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe that,” cried Lamont.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless it is true. Mother Flintstone was
your sister, Mr. Lamont.”</p>

<p>“That old hag? Impossible!”</p>

<p>“It is the truth, and, what is more, you knew it.”</p>

<p>“It is false!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“Shall I prove it?” asked the detective, not in the
least abating his coolness. “Shall I prove beyond
cavil to you that Mother Flintstone was your sister?”</p>

<p>“Who are you, man or devil?” exclaimed the money
king. “And what can buy your silence?”</p>

<p>“I have told you who I am, and nothing on earth
can buy my silence.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want to disgrace my family?”</p>

<p>“I am serving justice just now, no matter who is
disgraced.”</p>

<p>“It will kill my wife and daughter.”</p>

<p>“Even that event will not take me from my trail.”</p>

<p>“You have no heart.”</p>

<p>“Neither had the man who killed that old woman.”</p>

<p>“Who did it? Tell me that!”</p>

<p>“I am not quite prepared to answer, but in time I
will be. I am here to tell you that the death of your
ostracized sister shall be avenged, no matter whose
neck the rope stretches, figuratively speaking.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to insinuate that I had a hand
in the crime?”</p>

<p>“I make no charges. I merely called to ask if she
was not your sister?”</p>

<p>“I’ve answered that question.”</p>

<p>“And you let her go to the potter’s field?”</p>

<p>“I did, and I would do it again under the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me about my having no heart, Mr.
Lamont.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t think of acknowledging her and having
the body in my house.”</p>

<p>“That’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>Nick arose and was watched by the man with a
look like that of a tiger.</p>

<p>Perry Lamont seemed to bite his lips through and
his eyes emitted sparks of rage.</p>

<p>As the detective stepped toward the door it opened
and a tall and distinguished-looking young lady entered
the room.</p>

<p>“My daughter,” said the millionaire, with a wave
of his hand toward the young lady, but she did not
seem to hear the words.</p>

<p>Already she had turned upon Carter and her hands
were clenched till the nails seemed to cut the fair flesh
to the palms.</p>

<p>“You want to disgrace us all!” she cried, as she
appeared to increase an inch in stature. “You are one
of those blackmailers with whom honest and wealthy
people must be bothered. You want to make us
trouble. But you shall not! Father shall not pay you
one dollar to keep the false secret you think you have
discovered. Attempt to carry out your plans and your
life will not be worth the snuffing of a candle.”</p>

<p>Carter was astounded at these words, and he could
not take his eyes from the flushed face of the girl
who was really beautiful and vixenish.</p>

<p>“Be calm, miss,” said he. “I don’t intend to disgrace
your family name. The truth never hurt anybody.
I am a detective on the trail, and if that trail
leads to your house, why, you should not find fault,
for the dogs of justice seldom miss the scent.”</p>

<p>“But you just said the old creature murdered in her
hovel a few nights ago was my father’s sister.”</p>

<p>“Ask him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>Carter waved his hand toward the motionless man
in the chair.</p>

<p>“Father has not been himself for some time, and
to-night is not accountable for the admissions he may
have made.”</p>

<p>Carter looked again at Perry Lamont, whose gaze
had wandered to his daughter, and his hands, clasped
before, had fallen apart.</p>

<p>At that moment he did look like a man half demented,
but the detective soon returned to the tall
girl.</p>

<p>“You shan’t ruin us,” she cried. “You shall not
unite our name with that of Mother Flintstone, whose
life, I am told, was anything but honest. It will be
worth your life to do this.”</p>

<p>The look which accompanied these words told him
that they were meant for a terrible threat, and the
tightly shut hands of the speaker were proof that she
was a fitting sister for Claude Lamont.</p>

<p>“We will meet again, perhaps,” said the detective.
“I am going to run the guilty down. That is my
present mission.”</p>

<p>At this moment Perry Lamont raised his head and
looked at the detective.</p>

<p>“I’m not to be trifled with,” said he. “I can make
it hot for the man who brings us down to Mother
Flintstone’s level.”</p>

<p>“Well, you may proceed to do your worst,” was the
cool answer. “You may be ‘disgraced,’ as you say,
by the relationship, but this affair must not stop there.”</p>

<p>With this parting shot the detective put out his
hand to open the door, but the white fingers of the
daughter closed about his wrist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“Beware,” she almost hissed. “I don’t know who
took the old hag’s life, but you must not connect her
with our family.”</p>

<p>The detective shook the grip off and looked again
at Perry Lamont.</p>

<p>His head had dropped upon his breast, and his face
was deathly white.</p>

<p>“He’s gone into one of his strange spells,” said the
girl. “You see that he is almost an imbecile. At times
he seems his old self, but in reality he is but a human
wreck. I’ll give you ten thousand dollars to quit this
‘trail,’ as you call it.”</p>

<p>Ten thousand dollars!</p>

<p>Nick was silent and the girl took it as a sign of hesitation.</p>

<p>“I’ll write out the check now,” she went on. “It
shall be paid any way you want it.”</p>

<p>The detective shook his head.</p>

<p>“You won’t, eh?” cried Miss Lamont.</p>

<p>“I’m simply Nick Carter, and he has never been in
the market, miss,” was the response.</p>

<p>In an instant the girl’s countenance changed again
from expectancy to wrath.</p>

<p>She opened the door and pointed into the hall.</p>

<p>“Take what comes!” she hissed, and with this Carter
walked out.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>THE CARD CLEW.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Jack Redmond’s death promised to give the police
of New York another job, but no one suspected that
he was Carter’s spy.</p>

<p>The woman who had seen the strange man go up
to Redmond’s room had given her information to the
detective alone, and Nick kept it to himself.</p>

<p>He did not doubt that the crook had been put out
of the way because he was on the right trail in the
matter of spying, and as he—Carter—had set Jack to
keep track of Claude Lamont, he resolved to turn his
own attention to that young man.</p>

<p>Then, the disappearance of Margie from the Trocadero,
whither she had gone to meet a person discovered
to be the millionaire’s son, was an additional
incentive for the detective, and he went from Lamont’s
mansion to a certain part of the city where he expected
to find the heir.</p>

<p>Through it all he did not lose sight of the fact that
he was Mother Flintstone’s avenger.</p>

<p>That he kept in mind all the time, and with all his
foresight he went back to the original trail.</p>

<p>It was some time after the exciting interview we
have just recorded as taking place in the palatial home
of the retired money king that the figure of Carter
might have been seen to enter one of the fashionable
clubrooms of the city.</p>

<p>No one would have known him without an introduction,
and no one did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>Attired like a person well-to-do, with sleek garments
and a glossy beard over his smooth face, the
detective sat down in the smoking room.</p>

<p>The room was most brilliantly lit up and expensively
furnished, but the detective who had trailed men in
every walk of life was not astonished.</p>

<p>He drew a cigar from his pocket and puffed leisurely
away, all the time taking a good survey of the place.</p>

<p>A number of rich young men lounged about the
room, filling the plush chairs, while on the floor above
could be heard the noise of the billiard balls.</p>

<p>Presently a young man entered the smoking room
and took a seat nearly opposite the detective.</p>

<p>It was Claude Lamont.</p>

<p>Perry Lamont’s son showed signs of high living, for
his face was florid and his nerves a little unstrung.
He was faultlessly attired, for he had the best tailor
money could procure, and the detective watched him
furtively while he appeared to enjoy his Havana.</p>

<p>Claude Lamont seemed to have a good deal of time
on his hands, and so did Carter.</p>

<p>All at once a messenger boy entered the smoking
room and looked around.</p>

<p>Spying Claude, he hastened to him and handed him
a letter.</p>

<p>“Ha!” thought the watchful detective. “He is not
forgotten to-night, and now we’ll see if it is an important
message.”</p>

<p>Claude tipped the boy and opened the letter. He
started a little as his eye fell upon the page and quickly
glanced up as if to see if he were watched.</p>

<p>Then he settled down to a quiet perusal of the message,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
during which time Carter got a good look at the
workings of his countenance.</p>

<p>“Hang it all. It comes just when I don’t want to
be bothered with the matter,” growled Claude, as he
rammed the message hurriedly into his pocket and
then went toward the cloakroom.</p>

<p>Carter watched him through the open door and saw
the letter drop from his pocket as he put on his overcoat.</p>

<p>Lamont walked out without noticing his loss, and
the moment he vanished, the letter was in the detective’s
hands.</p>

<p>In another second Nick vanished, too, and as he
came out upon the steps in front of the club he spied
Lamont flitting around the nearest corner.</p>

<p>“Let him go. The quarry will not be missed just
yet,” smiled the detective, and then he went into a
near café and in one of the private stalls opened the
letter.</p>

<p>“Didn’t want this matter to come up just now,” he
laughed, as he glanced down the page. “Well, I should
think not.”</p>

<p>It did not take the man of many trails long to
master the lost missive, and when he finished he read
what follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Claude Lamont</span>: I send you this for the last
time. I will not be put off another day, and you must
take the consequences, if you have the hardihood to
do it. You know what I know, and if you do not come
down I will unseal my lips. You fly high, like a bird
with golden plumage, but I’ll clip your feathers and
bring you to prison if you don’t pay attention to this
letter. When my lips are unsealed there’ll be the biggest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
sensation New York has ever had, and you know
it. Don’t put me off another day. You know what
this means. I’m master of the field, and I can wreck
your every hope and blight your fashionable life.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Imogene.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>Twice did the detective read this over, and every
word seemed to engrave itself upon his mind.</p>

<p>Quietly he folded the letter and smiled.</p>

<p>Who was “Imogene”?</p>

<p>Looking for her would be like hunting for a needle
in the gutters of Gotham.</p>

<p>That she was a desperate woman the letter told him,
and he did not wonder that it paled Claude Lamont’s
cheeks.</p>

<p>Perhaps if he had followed the young man he might
have been guided by him to Imogene’s home, but he
had to be content for the present with the letter.</p>

<p>Nick, with the letter reposing in an inner pocket,
came out of the café and for a moment stood under
the lights that revealed the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“I’ll find the boy now,” he said. “Billy may have
discovered something since I last saw him.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he entered a little room on Mulberry
Street and aroused a boy who was sleeping on a
rude couch.</p>

<p>It was not far from Mother Flintstone’s late hovel,
and Billy looked astonished to see the detective in the
den.</p>

<p>“Been dreamin’ erbout you, Mr. Carter,” cried the
boy, as he rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll listen to the dream, Billy.”</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t any good, but all the time I saw your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
face in it. You know the man who dragged me from
Mother Flintstone’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I ran afoul of him to-night.”</p>

<p>“Where, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Back in the old place, but this time he didn’t get to
handle me.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“See here. He lost this in the house. It fell from
his pocket when he pulled his handkerchief out,” and
Billy handed the detective a card.</p>

<p>“Did you follow him after he left the old house?”
he asked the boy.</p>

<p>“No. I just let him go, for I wanted to see what
was on this card, for you, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Billy.”</p>

<p>The name on the card stood out in bold relief to
Nick’s gaze, and he saw there one he might have seen
before.</p>

<p>“You don’t know this George Richmond, do you,
Billy?” he asked, looking down at the boy on the edge
of the bed.</p>

<p>“I don’t.”</p>

<p>“George Richmond is a well-known man in certain
quarters, but of late he hasn’t shown up often.”</p>

<p>“Is he crooked, Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in a manner. How did he look to-night,
Billy?”</p>

<p>“He wore a brown beard and was well dressed.”</p>

<p>“Did he limp a little?”</p>

<p>“Bless me if he didn’t, but I wouldn’t have thought
of that if you hadn’t mentioned it.”</p>

<p>The detective seemed satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“What did he seem to want in Mother Flintstone’s
old quarters?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know. He sounded several of the walls,
as if looking for a secret door, but he didn’t appear to
find one.”</p>

<p>“Anything else?”</p>

<p>“He went over the floor like a fox, with his nose
close to the boards.”</p>

<p>“Was that all?”</p>

<p>“No, he even sounded the ceiling.”</p>

<p>“Quite particular,” smiled the detective.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t he, though? I never saw anything just
like that. He didn’t let an inch of space escape him.”</p>

<p>“Did he seem excited?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. He was as cool as a cucumber,
and not for a minute did he get off his base. He seemed
disappointed, though, that’s all—as if he expected to
find some hidden wealth and didn’t, you see.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he overlooked it, Billy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there was any to overlook,” said the
boy. “But, really, there’s no telling what that man
was huntin’, but he wasn’t thar for any good you can
bet your neck, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“I’ll agree with you on that score, boy,” and the
detective put the card in his pocket. “George Richmond
never goes out after small game. That’s his
record.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he had anything to do with the
murder of Mother Flintstone?” eagerly questioned the
boy.</p>

<p>“Time will tell,” was the detective’s reply. “Do you
think he had, Billy?”</p>

<p>“I do, I do,” cried the boy. “Bless me if I kin get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
the idea out o’ my head. That man either killed Mother
Flintstone or he knows who did.”</p>

<p>To this the detective made no reply, and he told
the boy to go back to bed.</p>

<p>“Have you struck any clew yet, Mr. Carter?” asked
Billy.</p>

<p>“A little one. There, go to bed and let me go to
work again.”</p>

<p>“I will, but keep an eye on the man I saw to-night
in Mother Flintstone’s house. He needs watchin’ day
and night. Good night, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later the famous detective was far
from Billy’s uncouth abode, and in an entirely different
part of the city.</p>

<p>He stopped at last, and looked up at a tall building
that seemed to cleave the darkened sky far overhead.</p>

<p>The brief inspection seemed to satisfy him, for he
entered the main hallway and began to climb the uncarpeted
stair.</p>

<p>He reached the third floor before he encountered
any one, and there he was suddenly brought to a halt
by a voice that rang down the ghostly corridor.</p>

<p>“Another step on your life! I have you at my
mercy and I never fail to bring down my man. Stand
where you are, for another step means a bullet in
your brain!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<small>THE BIRD IN THE DEATH TRAP.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Leaving Carter, the shadow, in the net of doom,
let us go back a little in our story of crime and see
how fared one of our other characters.</p>

<p>You will recollect Margie Marne’s visit to the Trocadero
in answer to the mysterious note which had
reached her, and how the detective discovered that the
person whom she encountered vanished with her into
the alley back of the café while the detective himself
was coolly and cleverly drugged by Caddy.</p>

<p>If the detective could have tracked the cab he would
have seen it stop in front of a frame building not far
from the East River.</p>

<p>He would have seen the door open and a man step
out.</p>

<p>This person looked cautiously around, as if he
feared he had been followed, but seeing that no one
was on his track, he reached into the dark depths of
the vehicle and brought out a limp form.</p>

<p>It was the form of the young girl, and he hastily
carried her into the house.</p>

<p>Margie looked unconscious, as, indeed, she was, for
she made no move of any kind, and once in the old
house the man laid his burden on a sofa.</p>

<p>Then he went outside and spoke to the man on the
box of the cab and the vehicle rattled away.</p>

<p>All this did not occupy much time, and had been
accomplished as neatly as ever a dastardly job was.</p>

<p>Soon afterward there was a slight movement on the
part of the girl on the sofa, and Margie looked up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>She seemed to have an indistinct recollection of what
had taken place, for she arose with difficulty and tottered
across the darkened apartment.</p>

<p>“This is not home,” she exclaimed. “Neither is it
the café where I met the stranger. What has happened
and how came I to this house? I will not remain
here. I must get out of this trap, for trap it
must surely be.”</p>

<p>She found the door, but could not open it, and then,
as a full sense of the horror overtook her, she fell
to the floor.</p>

<p>The next second the door opened softly, and a man
looked into the room.</p>

<p>His face, which was rather handsome, was full of
devilish triumph, and for half a second he gloated over
the body on the carpet.</p>

<p>“Caught,” he said. “Caught like a fly in the spider’s
web! You didn’t give us much trouble, girl. We expected
a little more than we met. But it’s all right.
Now the coast will soon be clear. I’ll just turn you
over to Nora.”</p>

<p>He went away with the last word on his lips, and
five minutes later a woman entered the room. She
looked like a typical jaileress, for she was tall, lean,
rawboned and dark-faced.</p>

<p>She smiled when she saw Margie.</p>

<p>“Another one!” she grinned. “This one won’t give
me much trouble. Why, she’s but a girl. And such
hands, too! I wonder where he netted her?”</p>

<p>She went to work restoring Margie to consciousness,
and in a short time succeeded.</p>

<p>At sight of her the young girl put forth her hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
in pleading gesture, but when the light fell upon the
woman’s face she shuddered and turned away.</p>

<p>“That’s right. I’m no beauty,” said the woman.
“I’m no princess like the one in the fairy tale. They
call me Nora, if you want to get acquainted with me.
Call me Nora, nothing more.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve got another name?”</p>

<p>“Guess not! Nora’s good enough for me.”</p>

<p>“Then Nora, where am I?”</p>

<p>“In my house.”</p>

<p>“Who brought me here?”</p>

<p>“There, don’t ask too many questions,” smiled the
dark jaileress. “You are liable to get some lies if
you do.”</p>

<p>“What, are you in the plot, too?”</p>

<p>“I know my business,” evasively answered the
woman. “You don’t think I live here for nothing,
little one?”</p>

<p>Margie felt hope almost desert her soul.</p>

<p>“But you don’t intend to keep me here,” she cried.
“You have no right to do that.”</p>

<p>“I obey orders, never asking any questions.”</p>

<p>“Then it is a plot against me. I remember the visit
to the café. It was a decoy letter, after all. I went;
I fell into the snare and here I am—lost!”</p>

<p>“Don’t take such a black view of matters and
things,” was the reply. “Mebbe they aren’t quite as
dark as you paint them.”</p>

<p>“They are dark enough,” said the despairing girl.
“You shall not keep me here.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Then go.”</p>

<p>Margie bounded across the room and caught the
doorknob wildly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“Why don’t you open the door?” coolly asked Nora.</p>

<p>“Heavens, I cannot!”</p>

<p>“That’s the easiest way to find out. No, you can’t
get out till I say so.”</p>

<p>Margie looked at the woman and then once more
at the window between her and the street.</p>

<p>“I’ll call for help,” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“All right, miss.”</p>

<p>In a moment the poor girl was at the window, but
when she drew back the curtain she saw inner shutters
of iron.</p>

<p>Truly she was in durance.</p>

<p>“Why am I here? Surely you will tell me that?
What have I done to deserve this fate?”</p>

<p>“Wait and see. You want some sleep, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“In this terrible house? No!”</p>

<p>“But you must take a little rest. Come.”</p>

<p>Nora gripped Margie’s wrist and led her from the
room. She escorted her upstairs and into a smaller
apartment on the floor, where she pointed toward a
bed.</p>

<p>“Not a particle of sleep till you tell me why I am
treated thus,” cried the distracted girl.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll remain a long while awake,” was the
quick answer. “I’ll tell you nothing.”</p>

<p>Margie grew desperate. She darted forward and
clutched the woman’s sleeve and looking into her face
saw it grow white.</p>

<p>“Tell me!” cried Margie. “I am the victim of some
awful plot. Is it because I am the detective’s friend?”</p>

<p>“The detective?” echoed Nora. “What detective?”</p>

<p>“Nicholas Carter.”</p>

<p>The name had a magical effect on the woman, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
she shrank as far away as Margie’s hand would let
her, and for half a minute gazed into the girl’s face.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” she cried.</p>

<p>“On the trail.”</p>

<p>“On what trail?”</p>

<p>“On the trail of the hand that stilled Mother Flintstone’s
life.”</p>

<p>“My God! Can this be true, girl?”</p>

<p>“It is true, and because I am Nick’s friend I am
here. You know him.”</p>

<p>Nora did not speak, but her lips parted in a gasp
and she looked away.</p>

<p>“You don’t want that man to implicate you in the
plot, do you?” asked Margie.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“You don’t want to hang with the balance?”</p>

<p>“I won’t; the rope that hangs me isn’t made. The
hemp has never grown for that purpose.”</p>

<p>“Then let me out of here.”</p>

<p>“To tell on me—to go to Carter with the story of
where you’ve been?”</p>

<p>“I’ll shield you, Nora.”</p>

<p>Margie thought she was making headway with her
jaileress, but the next moment dispelled her hopes.</p>

<p>“Not for the world, girl,” said Nora. “I can’t afford
to do that. It would doom me.”</p>

<p>“But this man will find out. He intends to discover
the hand that took the old woman’s life. The murderer
never escapes Nick Carter. He is doomed from the
moment the trail is found.”</p>

<p>“I know him.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t want to be dragged into his net.
I am more than Margie Marne. I have another name,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
as I verily believe, and the man who brought me here
knows that.”</p>

<p>“I cannot say.”</p>

<p>“It is the foulest plot ever hatched in this or any
other city. Look here: Mother Flintstone lived alone
in squalor and apparent poverty. One night she is
killed—stabbed in the neck. Why was the life of the
old woman taken? Who was the man who came back
to the window, back to the scene of his crime to be
discovered by little Billy, the street rat? What was
Mother Flintstone to that man?”</p>

<p>“Was he the murderer?” asked Nora.</p>

<p>“If not, why did he come there? As I live, I believe
that man has Mother Flintstone’s blood on his hands.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said, dropping her voice almost
to a whisper. “But go to sleep, girl. I can’t let you
out.”</p>

<p>In another moment Margie was alone, for the
woman had broken from her grasp, and the girl heard
her footsteps on the stairs beyond the room.</p>

<p>“I see. This woman is merely the tool of the plotters,”
thought the detective’s fair friend. “She serves
them, while she fears Mr. Carter. Nora knows the
detective, but she stands by the man who brought me
to this place.”</p>

<p>The girl did not dream of going to bed.</p>

<p>She went to the window, and found it shuttered like
the one in the lower room.</p>

<p>The old house was a prison, which seemed as solid
as the Bastille, and at last Margie came away from
the window.</p>

<p>An hour passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>She heard footsteps come up the stairs and stop at
the door.</p>

<p>It was Nora coming back to see if she was asleep,
and in a few seconds the steps receded.</p>

<p>At last she threw herself upon the bed, and, wearied
out, fell into a dreamless slumber.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, she opened her eyes, and then
bounded from the couch.</p>

<p>Smoke which seemed to pour into the room over
the door almost suffocated her.</p>

<p>She shrieked for help, she beat the door with her
hands, she was here, there, everywhere.</p>

<p>But no help came, and as the walls of the little room
grew hot Margie Marne fell senseless and hopeless to
the floor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<small>CARTER AND HIS QUARRY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It looked like a diabolical plot to make way with the
girl who had interested herself in the death of Mother
Flintstone.</p>

<p>Margie cried again for help, but none seemed to
come.</p>

<p>She heard the roar of flames just beyond the door,
and knew that it was locked.</p>

<p>Seconds seemed hours to the doomed maiden, and
she felt her strength leave her.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a crash, and some one broke
into the room.</p>

<p>Margie tried to rise, but her powers could not stand
the strain, and she fell back once more.</p>

<p>She felt some one lift her from the bed and carry
her from the room. She heard voices as in a dream,
she felt smoke and flame in her face, and then a rush
of cold air.</p>

<p>Was she saved?</p>

<p>Had she been carried from the jaws of death and
would she be able to tell the story of her escape?</p>

<p>She did not know.</p>

<p>When she came to again she saw a woman standing
over her, and a gentle hand was laid upon her brow.</p>

<p>“It was a narrow escape, child,” said the nurse, and
Margie looked up with a query in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“All I know is that a fireman saved you in the nick
of time. He carried you from the house, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
entirely consumed. It was a brave act, and will get
him a medal.”</p>

<p>“But the woman?”</p>

<p>“They saw no one but you in the house. Was there
another?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Nora.”</p>

<p>The nurse shook her head.</p>

<p>“The other one may have left the house in time,”
she remarked.</p>

<p>“She was my jaileress.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to tell me that you were in that
house against your will?”</p>

<p>“That’s it exactly.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t know who Nora is?”</p>

<p>“I do not.”</p>

<p>Later in the day Margie, now fully recovered from
the shock, was able to sit up, and an officer came to
see her.</p>

<p>“The man I want to see is Mr. Carter, the detective.
I will talk to him,” said the girl, and they telephoned
for the detective.</p>

<p>In a short time the answer came back that the detective
could not be found, and Margie adhered to her
declaration that she would talk to no one but him.</p>

<p>Meantime Carter, whom we left in the corridor of
the tall building with a revolver at his head, had had
an adventure of his own.</p>

<p>Eager to discover something about the man who had
lost a card in Mother Flintstone’s den, he had made
his way to the building, only to reach the third floor,
where he was met by a man who covered him and told
him that another step would seal his doom.</p>

<p>The detective had not bargained for an adventure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
of this kind, and the threat took him unawares. He
could see the well-built figure of the speaker, though
it was not too well revealed, but the man’s face seemed
to be half concealed by a mask.</p>

<p>He stood but a few feet from the detective, and
Nick noticed that the hand which held the weapon did
not quiver.</p>

<p>There was a desperate man behind the six-shooter.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” suddenly demanded the
stranger.</p>

<p>“I want to see you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m here.”</p>

<p>“George Richmond, we have not met for some
time.”</p>

<p>The stranger laughed.</p>

<p>“George Richmond, eh? You don’t take me for that
worthy, do you?”</p>

<p>“You are that man and no one else,” was the reply.
“I am here to tell you this in spite of the menace of
the revolver.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want with George Richmond?”</p>

<p>Nicholas Carter waved his hand toward a door near
the man, and continued:</p>

<p>“You live in this building. We cannot talk in this
hall.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Come this way, sir.”</p>

<p>For the first time the weapon was lowered, and
the man called George Richmond by the detective
opened the door.</p>

<p>His action revealed a room scantily furnished, but
Carter stepped forward.</p>

<p>The moment he crossed the threshold the door was
shut, and the other turned a key in the lock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“Now, sir, what is it?” he demanded.</p>

<p>The detective turned and looked him in the face.</p>

<p>“You have been to Hell’s Kitchen,” said the detective,
as coolly as if he addressed a man in the chief’s
private room, instead of where he was.</p>

<p>“That’s news to me,” laughed the listener, as his
face seemed to lose color. “What business would I
have in that delectable locality?”</p>

<p>“Never mind that. You went there.”</p>

<p>“Who says so?”</p>

<p>“The person who saw you.”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“The person who saw you,” repeated the detective,
with emphasis, as he watched the man like a hawk.</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?”</p>

<p>“You sounded the walls.”</p>

<p>“In Hell’s Kitchen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in Mother Flintstone’s den.”</p>

<p>“Why, she’s dead.”</p>

<p>“That’s true. You went to her house and sounded
the walls. You examined the floor and looked closely
at the ceiling.”</p>

<p>The fellow seemed to grow desperate.</p>

<p>“What if I did?” he growled.</p>

<p>“You lost something there.”</p>

<p>The man started.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know that a man bent on evil always
leaves a clew behind?”</p>

<p>“That’s an old story, but they don’t always do that.
In the first place, you have nothing to prove that I
went to Mother Flintstone’s den. I defy you.”</p>

<p>One of Carter’s hands vanished into a pocket, and
came out with a small card between thumb and finger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>“You left this there,” said he, coolly, displaying the
bit of pasteboard.</p>

<p>The other fastened his eyes upon the card for a
moment, and then glared at Carter.</p>

<p>“Supposing all this is true,” he said; “what are you
going to make out of it?”</p>

<p>“You went there after something the old woman
is supposed to have concealed in the den. That is
why you searched the walls, George Richmond. Did
you do it for your friend, or was it all done on your
own hook?”</p>

<p>“For my friend?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for the friend you serve—the money king’s
heir.”</p>

<p>At this there was a sudden start, and Richmond
looked toward the door.</p>

<p>“You are taking desperate chances in order to keep
up your reputation as a detective,” he said at last. “I
never thought you would resort to this. I know you.
I know that you are Nick Carter, the detective, but
with all your shrewdness you can’t hoodwink me.”</p>

<p>With this the speaker moved toward the door and
laid his hand upon the knob.</p>

<p>Before Carter could cross the room he saw the door
flung open, and the man sprang out into the hall.</p>

<p>The portal was slammed in Carter’s face, and a key
turned in the lock.</p>

<p>All this was the work of a second, and he heard the
feet of the other on the stairs without.</p>

<p>As for himself, he was a prisoner in the room.</p>

<p>The gas burning overhead revealed the place to him,
and he went back and stood for a little while at the
table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>He felt that Richmond was already on the street
below and out of sight.</p>

<p>“I must follow that villain,” said Nick, and again
he was at the door.</p>

<p>All his strength could not move the portal, and then
he threw himself against it, but still it would not yield.</p>

<p>Other doors had fallen before his assaults, but this
one seemed built of adamant, and he drew back out
of breath, but by no means discouraged.</p>

<p>He knew he was in the third story of a building,
and that the room looked out upon a narrow alleyway
between two houses. This he could see from the window,
and he saw, too, that he could not reach the
fire escape from where he was without great risk.</p>

<p>But it was not his intention to remain in the room
any longer than he could help it.</p>

<p>He raised the sash and measured the distance to
the fire escape, upon which he would be safe.</p>

<p>The detective studied the situation for a short time,
and then dexterously leaped for the escape.</p>

<p>His hands caught the irons, and he drew himself
upon the platform.</p>

<p>There he stopped a little while for breath and looked
around.</p>

<p>No one seemed to have witnessed his feat, and he
congratulated himself in silence that so far he had
succeeded almost beyond his expectations.</p>

<p>In another minute he was going down the iron rungs
of the ladder with the escaping villain in his mind.</p>

<p>By that time George Richmond was far away, but
the detective hoped still to overhaul him.</p>

<p>He gained the street, none the worse for his startling
adventure, but, of course, the quarry was gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>A few yards distant on a corner with the lamplight
falling upon his figure stood a policeman, and Carter
went toward him.</p>

<p>The copper had seen a man pass a short time before,
and told Nick so.</p>

<p>“He went that way a little fast,” said the policeman,
pointing down the street, and as Carter started off a
carriage came around the corner.</p>

<p>The light for a moment fell upon it, and the detective
caught sight of a man’s face at the window.</p>

<p>He knew it at once—the face of Claude Lamont!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<small>STARTLING DEVELOPMENTS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Just what the millionaire’s son was doing in that
part of the city at that hour Carter could not conceive,
but that his mission was not of the most honest kind
he did not doubt.</p>

<p>The carriage was out of sight in a few moments,
and the detective was alone with the patrolman.</p>

<p>Seeing that it was not worth while trying to find
Richmond in that locality, the detective made his way
to his own quarters near Broadway.</p>

<p>The moment he opened the door he was surprised
to see Billy, the street waif, spring from a couch in
one corner of the room and bound toward him.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him located now!” cried the boy.</p>

<p>“You’ve got who located, Billy?”</p>

<p>“The man who gave me the slip the other night on
the street.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>Billy told the detective that if he would follow him
he would show him the man in question, and Nick
obeyed.</p>

<p>“Look at the gentleman over there at the table in
the corner,” said the boy, when he had taken Carter
to a little theater and from a secluded spot in the
gallery pointed to a man at a table on the ground
floor.</p>

<p>“That’s Claude Lamont. This is luck, Billy! When
did you see him come here?”</p>

<p>“Half an hour ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“Well, I’ll take care of him now.”</p>

<p>The detective sat down and watched the man below.</p>

<p>The place was a free-and-easy, and the resort of a
good many shady people, but on that particular night
it did not seem to enjoy its usual custom.</p>

<p>The detective could easily believe that Claude Lamont
could have been driven to the free-and-easy
after he saw his face in the cab, and now he intended
to keep the young fellow in sight.</p>

<p>For an hour Carter kept his post, when Claude
suddenly arose and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>In another moment he spoke to a man near the
table and that person nodded.</p>

<p>Nick left his seat and kept an eye on the nabob’s
son.</p>

<p>Claude coolly lit a cigar at the counter and moved
toward the street.</p>

<p>On the sidewalk he looked both ways and then
started off.</p>

<p>Carter was at his heels.</p>

<p>Lamont walked several squares and then turned up
the steps of a well-to-do house.</p>

<p>The detective drew back.</p>

<p>Soon after the door had been shut a light appeared
in the front window.</p>

<p>Almost at the same time the door of the adjoining
house opened slightly and a face peeped out.</p>

<p>“Heavens! Bristol Clara!” cried the detective the
moment he spied this face. “Things are playing into
my hands better than I deserve. I wonder if she will
serve me now.”</p>

<p>The door had barely shut ere Carter was there and
his ring caused it to open again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>There was a slight cry from the woman in the hall,
and the detective pushed in and faced her.</p>

<p>“You?” cried the woman, falling back. “You said
you would never bother me again.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, Clara, but this is for the last time.
Who is your neighbor?”</p>

<p>“Ha! don’t you know?”</p>

<p>“If I did I wouldn’t ask you, would I?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. You want to find out something
about them?”</p>

<p>“There are two, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes; one just came home.”</p>

<p>“Which one, woman?”</p>

<p>“The one with the dust.”</p>

<p>“The other is the featherless bird, is he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he’s the coolest one, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p>“You don’t live here for nothing, Clara. This is a
sort of double house.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what it is.”</p>

<p>“Then, you know how to see what is going on in the
side over there. I want to see, too.”</p>

<p>The woman moved across the room and was followed
by the detective.</p>

<p>“What’s the case now? Tell me that first,” said
Bristol Clara, stopping suddenly and turning upon the
detective.</p>

<p>“Murder.”</p>

<p>The woman started.</p>

<p>“Is it that bad?” she exclaimed. “Who was the victim—man
or woman?”</p>

<p>“One of your sex.”</p>

<p>“Old or young?”</p>

<p>“An old woman—a ‘fence,’ Clara.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“Not——”</p>

<p>Bristol Clara stopped and looked away.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ve heard about the crime,” said the
detective. “I am on the trail of the murderer of
Mother Flintstone.”</p>

<p>“I thought so. Well, the secret may be in that house
beyond this partition. Those men have talked about
that very crime. I’ve heard them.”</p>

<p>The woman led the detective upstairs and opened a
small door in one of the walls.</p>

<p>A dark apartment was disclosed, and she entered,
followed by the man at her heels.</p>

<p>“We are now in the other house,” said Clara, laying
her hand on the detective’s arm, which she found in
the dark. “Here is a stairway which I accidentally
discovered last summer, and which I have used on
several occasions.”</p>

<p>“It leads down to the room where I saw the light,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. There is a hole in the ceiling. I made
it with a knife. You see, I didn’t know how soon I
would be wanting to find out something about my
neighbors, so I haven’t been idle.”</p>

<p>“You’re worth your weight in gold, Clara.”</p>

<p>In a little while Carter found himself in another
dark place, and Clara pointed to a ray of light that
seemed to come up from some place under their feet,
and the detective drew closer.</p>

<p>“Put your eye down to it,” said the woman.</p>

<p>This Nick did, and soon became accustomed to the
scene beneath him.</p>

<p>He was looking into a large and expensively furnished
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>Pictures in large gilt frames were arranged on the
walls, and thick Brussels carpet covered the floor.</p>

<p>The chandeliers were of expensive make, and
everything betokened great wealth.</p>

<p>The room was inhabited at the time by a man who
reclined in an armchair under the main light.</p>

<p>Carter knew him at once.</p>

<p>It was Claude Lamont.</p>

<p>The detective had a good chance to study the young
man’s features, and he could note how eager he seemed
to greet some one. He was not kept long in suspense
when the door leading to the main hall opened and
some one entered.</p>

<p>“George Richmond—my old friend,” smiled Nick,
as he watched the other one. “He gave me the slip
in the tall building, and now greets his old chum,
Claude.”</p>

<p>“You’re a little behind,” said Claude, looking at his
friend. “You must have had an adventure.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’ve had,” laughed the other,
taking a cigar from the open box on the table at
Lamont’s elbow. “Say I didn’t play it on the shrewdest
old ferret in the city, will you?”</p>

<p>“On a detective? What, have you had a bout with
one of those people?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I? I left him in durance, and it will be
some time before he gets out, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p>“Come, tell the whole story. I’ve had a little adventure
myself,” exclaimed Lamont. “You don’t mean
to say that you’ve had a little episode with our
friend Carter?”</p>

<p>“With no one else.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you silence him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“I hardly know. But we’ll fix him later on.”</p>

<p>“Did he know you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What gave you away?”</p>

<p>“One of my old cards. I lost it in the den.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve been back there, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I went back to give the old place another
inspection. I sounded the walls and inspected the
floor, but I couldn’t find the papers.”</p>

<p>“Then they don’t exist.”</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to think that way myself. But the
old hag certainly knew the truth, and don’t you think
she made out just such papers intending to leave them
some day to the girl or to the street rat?”</p>

<p>“To the girl perhaps, but never to the rat,” said
Lamont. “Margie knows a good deal, and would be
a dangerous person for us to fight if she had the
cleverness of some women. But she’s caged for some
time, and Nora will see that she remains silent. But
the papers? We must have something of the kind.
If Mother Flintstone did not leave such, we must
make them.”</p>

<p>“Now, that’s it.”</p>

<p>“The governor won’t knuckle down till he sees them,
and then we’ll get all we want.”</p>

<p>For half a second Richmond smoked in silence, and
then he threw away his cigar.</p>

<p>“We must make the papers!” he cried. “Your
father, Perry Lamont, must give you free use of his
purse strings. When I called on him and threatened
to send you to the gallows unless he handed over ten
thousand dollars he laughed in my face, and I came
away with no cash at all. But I picked a check book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
from the desk, as you know, with one good check
filled out. That’s helped us some.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but it’s a mere drop in the bucket. The
governor must be confronted with certain papers proving
that Mother Flintstone was his sister and my aunt.
That will open the cash box, I guess!”</p>

<p>And young Lamont laughed.</p>

<p>“The infernal villains!” ejaculated Carter, as these
details of infamy fell upon his ears; “if that isn’t a
gallows pair then I never saw one in all my life. Claude
Lamont can’t get his hands on the Lamont cash box,
and that’s what worries him. One of those men killed
Mother Flintstone; but which one?”</p>

<p>In another moment Claude and Richmond arose and
left the room, and Bristol Clara said:</p>

<p>“That ends the exhibition for the present,” and the
detective answered that he was satisfied.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV.<br />

<small>A TERRIBLE COMPACT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Perry Lamont, the millionaire, stood underneath the
brilliant chandelier in his luxurious library, apparently
waiting for some one. He looked anxiously toward the
door, and when it opened his eyes glittered.</p>

<p>The person who entered the room was his son.</p>

<p>For half a second father and son stood face to face,
and then the former waved the other to a chair.</p>

<p>Claude, looking a little worse for the night out,
complied, and waited for his father to speak.</p>

<p>“Who is this man Richmond?” asked Lamont,
senior.</p>

<p>The young man started.</p>

<p>“He is your friend, I believe?”</p>

<p>“He is, and he is a nice gentleman,” said Claude.</p>

<p>“I judge so,” and a smile came to the father’s lips.</p>

<p>“What has happened? You speak sarcastically this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Do I? Well, I want you to give up this ‘nice gentleman.’”</p>

<p>Claude looked away, but in a moment his gaze came
back to his father’s face.</p>

<p>“This man is a rascal,” spoke up the millionaire.</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty bold charge against a friend of
mine.”</p>

<p>“Bold or not, it’s true.”</p>

<p>“Who is the accuser?”</p>

<p>“Never mind that.”</p>

<p>“I demand to know. Mr. Richmond has a right to
face his accuser, and he will do so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“But you haven’t denied the charge of your friend.”</p>

<p>“I do it now.”</p>

<p>“Then he is a nice gentleman still, is he?”</p>

<p>“He is, sir.”</p>

<p>Claude flushed.</p>

<p>“I am the accuser,” and the face of the millionaire
grew white. “I call him a rascal.”</p>

<p>“Upon what grounds?”</p>

<p>“He tried to blackmail me.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Richmond?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. That man came here but a few days ago
and wanted to rob me of ten thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” cried Claude, feigning astonishment.</p>

<p>“It is true, and what is more, he hinted that you had
committed a great crime.”</p>

<p>“Come, come; you must have been dreaming.”</p>

<p>“I was as wide awake then as I am now.”</p>

<p>Lamont, senior, smiled knowingly.</p>

<p>“You must drop this black bird.”</p>

<p>“I am of age and have the right to choose my
friends,” was his son’s answer.</p>

<p>“Then keep him and yourself in the future.”</p>

<p>The young man gazed at his father in wide-open
astonishment.</p>

<p>“You certainly don’t mean that,” he said.</p>

<p>“I do. He is your friend, you say. Keep him and
yourself. I guess that’s plain.”</p>

<p>Claude Lamont arose and crossed the room.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you do,” he cried.</p>

<p>“I know what I do. It is either lose this friend, as
you call him, or lose your fortune.”</p>

<p>“He never tried to blackmail you.”</p>

<p>“He did!” thundered the nabob. “In this very room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
he wanted to sell the so-called secret for ten thousand
dollars. I drove him away. I wouldn’t have anything
to do with the scoundrel. But it seems you do. You
are with him night and day, and you are old enough
to know that you can’t play with pitch and not become
defiled.”</p>

<p>Claude smiled derisively at this, and for a moment
was silent.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he suddenly said, “I can’t give this
man up. He knows too much.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Lamont, senior. “Do you
admit that you are in his power?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say so. I only remarked that I can’t throw
him to one side. He knows too much.”</p>

<p>“Against whom?”</p>

<p>“Against the house.”</p>

<p>“It cannot be.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s true. This man is my friend, and
I have been keeping near him for a purpose, and that
purpose the salvation of the good name of Lamont.”</p>

<p>A strange and eager light seemed to come into the
millionaire’s eyes, and for half a second he did not
continue.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” he said. “Tell me what this man
knows.”</p>

<p>Claude went back to the chair.</p>

<p>“He knows a good deal more than we can afford to
let him tell,” he said. “I don’t say that Richmond will
tell the secret on the street or anything of that kind,
but we can’t afford to let him have the opportunity.”</p>

<p>“In God’s name, what is the secret?”</p>

<p>“Of course he never told me, but I only guess at it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
from hints he has dropped while in his cups. It’s a
terrible thing, if it’s true—a fearful secret, father.”</p>

<p>“Out with it. I am strong, you see, and can listen
to any recital you make.”</p>

<p>Claude crossed the room, and looked cautiously into
the hall.</p>

<p>No one was there.</p>

<p>Coming back, he resumed his seat in the chair and
looked at the white-faced man opposite.</p>

<p>“Whatever became of Aunt Hester?” he asked.</p>

<p>The expression that came into Perry Lamont’s face
was most startling.</p>

<p>Every vestige of color left it, and it became as
white as a marble statue.</p>

<p>“Who ever told you that I had a sister named Hester?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Never mind that. I only asked the question.”</p>

<p>“Is this some of your friend’s work?”</p>

<p>“That is a part of his secret. He says he has certain
papers that will startle the world, that he has in
his possession a certain confession or a family history
written out by an old woman who called herself——”</p>

<p>Young Lamont paused, for his father was gasping
like a man fighting for his breath.</p>

<p>“Go on. Tell me all. What did this woman call
herself?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Mother Flintstone,” coolly said the son. “She
lived in Hell’s Kitchen, and after being threatened a
number of times—in spite of the protection of Carter’s
assistants—she was murdered a few nights ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. I saw something of that in the newspapers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“Well, from what I have heard Richmond say in a
dark way when in his cups he can prove that Mother
Flintstone, the old fence, was your sister.”</p>

<p>“Great heavens!” cried Perry Lamont. “Has he got
the documents left by this woman?”</p>

<p>“I fear he has.”</p>

<p>“But he didn’t offer them to me.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say as to that.”</p>

<p>“He only offered to keep the knowledge of your
doings from the world for ten thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“But he has the papers now. I am confident of
that.”</p>

<p>“Will he sell them?” eagerly asked the millionaire.</p>

<p>“He might.”</p>

<p>“For how much?”</p>

<p>“You must negotiate with him.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Claude, my boy. Can’t you get possession
of those papers?”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Any way, I don’t care how you get them.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t want me to rob my friend?”</p>

<p>“I say I don’t care how you get them.”</p>

<p>“But he would still possess the secret.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take care of him after the documents have
been found. How did he get them? Was he familiar
with Mother Flintstone?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Merciless villain! He holds the peace of our house
in his hands. The man is the quintessence of rascality.
Talk about your polished blackmailers. He stands at
the head of the procession. I’ll hand him over to the
police at once.”</p>

<p>“Try it, and the whole thing will come out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>Lamont, senior, gasped again.</p>

<p>“Where does Richmond board?”</p>

<p>“He changes his place often. I don’t believe he
sleeps two nights in the same place.”</p>

<p>“Like the sultan. But, look here, my boy. You
don’t want the good name of our house destroyed?”</p>

<p>“One of the last things I want to see,” said the
young rake.</p>

<p>“Then help me destroy this man. Help me to get
those papers and silence him.”</p>

<p>“It is true, then?”</p>

<p>“It is true.”</p>

<p>“Mother Flintstone was your sister?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. She was Hester, the sister who contracted
a poor marriage years ago and finally drifted
into crime.”</p>

<p>Claude Lamont seemed struck with a thunderbolt,
and for some time he sat in the presence of his father,
dazed and speechless.</p>

<p>“I had hoped the truth would never come out,” continued
the millionaire. “I accidentally discovered a
year ago who Mother Flintstone was, but I said nothing.
I would have given her thousands to have thrown
herself from the bridge or to have left the city, but
I dared not approach her. And so she left a confession
behind; she has left the secret to a scoundrel like this
George Richmond. Why, this man has more names
than one.”</p>

<p>“A good many people have nowadays,” answered
Claude.</p>

<p>“Well, he must be silenced somehow.”</p>

<p>“With money?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“Not if I can help it. I would like to know what
sort of communication Mother Flintstone left.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me the best way to deal with the secret
holder is to come to his terms,” suggested Claude.</p>

<p>“And be bled every now and then? I’ll defy him
first!”</p>

<p>“Come, come. You can’t afford to do that. Think
of our station in society. Sister is on the eve of
marriage, and mother’s health is not what it used to be.
We must come to his terms to save the house of Lamont.”</p>

<p>The millionaire began to pace the floor like a wild
beast.</p>

<p>“What will you take to strangle the scoundrel,
Claude?” he suddenly exclaimed, halting before his
son. “You have every opportunity. Name your price.”</p>

<p>“You don’t really mean that?” cried the young man.</p>

<p>“I do, every word of it. What will you take to
silence this man forever?”</p>

<p>“Two hundred thousand cash in hand.”</p>

<p>“Done!” exclaimed the millionaire. “That’s a bargain!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<small>THE DARK JAILERESS AGAIN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was a cool compact.</p>

<p>Perry Lamont made answer to his son with all the
cleverness of a practiced villain, and Claude accepted
it in the same manner.</p>

<p>“I want this man silenced,” continued the millionaire.
“He must not possess this secret.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say,” said Claude, picking up a cigar
and coolly lighting it.</p>

<p>“He must not, I say. You’ve agreed to finish him,
and when you’ve done so the money is yours.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you give me a little check now?” asked
the son.</p>

<p>Perry Lamont took a check book from the desk
and opened it as he looked at his son.</p>

<p>“How much?”</p>

<p>“Say five thousand. I may need the money in the
venture, you know.”</p>

<p>Without more ado the nabob drew up a check for
five thousand dollars, and passed it across the table.</p>

<p>“This business must not lag,” said he. “While that
man lives he is dangerous.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later the young man stood on a corner
in another part of the city. He was smoking complacently
and apparently waiting for some one, for he
watched the door of a well-known resort.</p>

<p>Presently the door opened and George Richmond
came out.</p>

<p>Claude joined him at once, and the pair walked
away together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>In a little while they seated themselves at a table
in a room not far from the corner, and Claude threw
the check upon the table.</p>

<p>“Jehu! did you make it?” cried Richmond.</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>The young scamp smiled.</p>

<p>“It’s blood money,” he said.</p>

<p>“Blood money?” exclaimed Richmond. “In Heaven’s
name, whose blood does it mean?”</p>

<p>“Yours!”</p>

<p>“Come, what joke is this?”</p>

<p>“It is no joke. I never joke on serious matters
like this.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the two men met.</p>

<p>“This check is signed by your father, and yet you
tell me that it is blood money.”</p>

<p>“That’s precisely what it is. He’s hired me to
kill you.”</p>

<p>George Richmond broke into a laugh and leaned
back in his chair.</p>

<p>“You don’t look like it, boy,” he cried. “Well, if
I’m to be killed, why don’t you do it now?”</p>

<p>Claude reached forward and picked up the check.</p>

<p>“I’m to have a cool two hundred thousand for the
job,” said he. “Just think of it! You’re an important
person.”</p>

<p>“Hang me if I ain’t. Why does the old man want
me out of the way?”</p>

<p>“You hold the secret, and he believes you have the
papers left by Mother Flintstone.”</p>

<p>“You gave him that gaff, did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in great shape.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“I hardly thought you’d do it. But since you have I
suppose you’re to furnish proofs that I’ve been killed.”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“You are not expected to furnish the corpse, I
hope?”</p>

<p>“No; not quite that. But he’s to have some sort of
proofs, and then we’ll get the two hundred thousand.”</p>

<p>For an hour these men kept their heads together
and talked in low tones.</p>

<p>They discussed first one plan and then another, and
when they at last adjourned and stepped out upon the
street they seemed satisfied about something.</p>

<p>Not far from the place of meeting a hand was laid
upon Claude Lamont’s arm, and he looked into the face
of a tall woman.</p>

<p>“You?” he cried, for he was alone, having separated
from Richmond a few moments previous.</p>

<p>“Yes? Why not?”</p>

<p>“I thought I left you in the nest with Margie.”</p>

<p>“So you did, but there isn’t any nest now.”</p>

<p>“No nest? What’s happened?”</p>

<p>“The old place is in ashes.”</p>

<p>Lamont uttered a startled cry, and looked at the
woman, who did not speak.</p>

<p>“You weren’t to hurt the girl, you know?” said he.</p>

<p>“That’s true, but I couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p>“But tell me. Come in here. No one will listen to
us. Now, what has taken place?”</p>

<p>Nora took a long breath and began.</p>

<p>“The girl got almost unruly. I got her up to bed,
but she faced me and threatened.”</p>

<p>“Well, you shouldn’t have paid any attention to her
words.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>“I couldn’t help it. She mentioned a name that
drove every vestige of color from my face.”</p>

<p>“An old enemy’s name, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes; she spoke of a detective whom I fear with
all my soul. She spoke of Carter.”</p>

<p>“And made you chicken-hearted, eh? Pshaw,
woman!”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it, I say. It filled me with fear, and
I broke away.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“By and by the room became still, and I found that
she was asleep at last.”</p>

<p>“That’s good.”</p>

<p>“In the room below I upset the lamp.”</p>

<p>“The devil you did, woman! You must have been
badly frightened.”</p>

<p>“I was. In an instant it seemed the fire was everywhere.
I saw it mount the stairs and dart toward the
girl’s room. Fear almost paralyzed me. I tried to
get upstairs, but failed. The fire was everywhere.
It filled the whole house, it seemed. I could no more
stop its progress than I could stop the river yonder.
I fled for my life.”</p>

<p>“And left Margie to perish in the flames?”</p>

<p>“Got help me, I did.”</p>

<p>Lamont leaned back and looked at the woman,
whose face was deathly white.</p>

<p>“Did she perish?” he asked at last.</p>

<p>“She must have died in the old house. I did not
stay to look after her. Fear lent speed to my limbs,
and I ran like a deer. Not for the world would I have
gone back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“You’ve killed the girl!” hissed Claude Lamont.
“You’ve made a murderess out of yourself.”</p>

<p>Nora did not speak, but looked into the young man’s
face and exposed anew the whiteness of her own.</p>

<p>“I suppose you haven’t been there since?” he said.</p>

<p>“What, go back to that spot? Never!”</p>

<p>Claude Lamont drained the glass at his elbow and
seemed to take a long breath.</p>

<p>“What makes you fear this man, Carter? What did
he ever do that gives you the chills?”</p>

<p>“That’s my secret,” cried the woman, half defiantly.</p>

<p>“What makes him your enemy, and, pray, what did
you do that his name terrifies you?”</p>

<p>She did not answer him.</p>

<p>“Look here!” suddenly said Claude. “If you’ve
killed the girl by your faint heart I’ll hold you responsible.”</p>

<p>“Just as you please,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Nora seemed to be getting her old nerve back, for
she spoke with spirit, and her cheeks flushed for the
first time.</p>

<p>“You never got such orders from me,” he went on.</p>

<p>“I know it. I dropped the lamp——”</p>

<p>“Come, no excuses,” interrupted the young man.
“I shall hold you responsible—guilty of murder.”</p>

<p>“Just as if you never did anything that has a shady
side,” hissed the woman. “You’re a nice man to talk
thus. What have you done that makes an angel out of
you, I should like to know?”</p>

<p>“No accusations, woman.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Will you hand me over to the police?
Will you tell the inspector that I am the last person
who saw the girl alive? I guess not!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“Don’t dare me.”</p>

<p>“What if I tell them that Margie was Mother Flintstone’s
granddaughter——”</p>

<p>“She wasn’t!” flashed Claude Lamont.</p>

<p>“You take it up in a jiffy,” grinned Nora. “If she
wasn’t why did you resent my words so soon?”</p>

<p>For half a second Lamont watched the dark face
before him, and then he said:</p>

<p>“We’ll call it quits. After all, perhaps you couldn’t
have helped it. The lamp fell from your hand, did it?”</p>

<p>“I told you once.”</p>

<p>“And you couldn’t stop the flames?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t. I’d give my eyes if that girl was alive
to-day. I did not do it intentionally. My evil genius
must have been on the watch.”</p>

<p>“We’ll say so, at any rate, Nora.”</p>

<p>It was the first time he had spoken her name during
the interview, and his voice was considerably softened.</p>

<p>“The department may have reached the fire in time
to save the girl,” he went on.</p>

<p>“No, no! she perished. The whole house was in
flames by the time I got away. I’m going now.”</p>

<p>“Still afraid of the detective’s shadow?”</p>

<p>“Never mind the detective. I’m going, I say.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you’re going away?”</p>

<p>“Yes—to put ten thousand miles between me and
that infernal crime of mine.”</p>

<p>Lamont drew forth his pocketbook and began to
count out some bills.</p>

<p>“Put up your money. It’s blood money!” cried
Nora. “I wouldn’t touch a penny of your father’s
wealth. I don’t want money. I’ve got all I shall
need.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“Then you’re going but a short distance?”</p>

<p>“Yes; not far.”</p>

<p>The last word seemed to come from between
clenched teeth, and a desperate look settled on the
woman’s face.</p>

<p>“Then here’s to you, Nora, and good luck go with
you,” and Lamont held out his hand.</p>

<p>She pushed it away, with a look of disdain.</p>

<p>“It’s like your money. There’s blood on it, too!”
she exclaimed. “Some day you’ll wish you had never
had anything to do with this game of crime. Good-by.”</p>

<p>She sprang up, gave him another look and vanished.</p>

<p>“She’s mad, but it’s all right. She will try the
river,” he laughed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

<small>FOUND IN THE TIDE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>After the scene the detective had witnessed through
Bristol Clara’s assistance he made his way to another
part of the city and entered a little house, where he
was confronted by Billy, the street rat.</p>

<p>The detective wanted to ascertain if the boy had
picked up anything new, and his first words startled
him.</p>

<p>“They didn’t burn her up, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t burn who up, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Margie, you know.”</p>

<p>The detective as yet had heard nothing of the fire
at which Margie Marne nearly lost her life, and he
lost no time questioning Billy.</p>

<p>The boy had heard of the fire through a fireman,
and had gone direct to the hospital, where he had
held an interview with the girl herself.</p>

<p>“I’ll see her, too,” said Nick. “This is important,
Billy, and Margie must be seen.”</p>

<p>Imagine the astonishment of the girl when she saw
Carter walking up the aisle toward her.</p>

<p>A smile of pleasure overspread her face, and she
held out her hand.</p>

<p>“This is indeed a great pleasure,” cried Margie.
“We’ve been sending after you, and just when we give
you up here you come. I’ve been within the shadow
of death.”</p>

<p>“So Billy told me.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if Nora, my jaileress, escaped?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>“We will find that out by and by. Tell me the whole
story, Margie, and then we will see what can be done.”</p>

<p>The girl proceeded, and gave the detective the entire
story of her adventures while in the hands of Claude
Lamont and under Nora’s care, and Nick listened attentively.</p>

<p>“I think I can locate your jaileress,” said he, at the
end of Margie’s narrative.</p>

<p>“Do so. She didn’t treat me badly, only she was
true to her master. She started at the mention of your
name, though.”</p>

<p>“Did she?” smiled Carter.</p>

<p>“It drove every vestige of color from her face.”</p>

<p>“She’s met me somewhere, then,” said the detective.
“I want to see Nora.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later the detective reached the scene
of the fire, and looked upon the ruins of Margie’s
prison.</p>

<p>The house had been entirely destroyed, and some
of the neighbors seemed glad that it was so.</p>

<p>“None of us liked the tall, dark-faced woman, with
the little, red scar over her left eye,” said a woman
who lived near the place, and whom the detective addressed.</p>

<p>“What did you call her?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we never called on her at all. She was very
exclusive.”</p>

<p>“Had no visitors, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sometimes. A man would drop in, generally
after dark, and stay about half an hour.”</p>

<p>“You saw him, did you?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it, you see, from where I live.”</p>

<p>“What was he like?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“He was younger than the woman. He was always
well dressed, like a swell nabob, and carried himself
like a sport.”</p>

<p>“Claude again,” thought Carter. “You never saw
the woman go out?”</p>

<p>His last question was addressed to the neighbor.</p>

<p>“Not often. She remained at home, and seemed to
attend to her own business.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure about that scar, are you?”</p>

<p>“Bless you, yes. I saw it more than once, when we
happened to meet in the little grocery on the corner
yonder. It was a real, red scar.”</p>

<p>Carter handed the woman a piece of money, which
she did not refuse, and went away. He went direct
to police headquarters and to the famous rogues’ gallery.</p>

<p>There he began to look through the large albums
containing the faces of criminals and suspects, and for
nearly an hour he turned the thick leaves industriously.</p>

<p>At last he stopped and leaned over the page.</p>

<p>His eyes seemed to become fastened upon a certain
face, that of a woman, angular and dark.</p>

<p>Turning to the proper entry he read a description
of the woman whose photographed face was before
him, and he seemed to smile when he noted that she had
a brilliant red scar over the left eye.</p>

<p>“This must be our old friend,” said the detective.
“This is Mag Maginnis, the shoplifter, whom I sent
up the river five years ago. I didn’t see the scar then.
She got it since, and the photograph is the second one
she’s had the honor of having in this collection. So
Mag started at mention of my name by Margie. No
wonder. I filled her with terror when I caught her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
in the dry-goods district in the very act of plundering
a counter. We’ll see.”</p>

<p>He shut the album and walked away.</p>

<p>The detective never let a trail get cold, and therefore
he proceeded to a part of the city where he hoped
to strike Mag’s trail.</p>

<p>“The Lord deliver us! Here’s Mr. Carter!” cried a
woman’s shrill voice, as the detective opened a door and
confronted a female at a table.</p>

<p>The woman had seen better days, for an air of refinement
still lingered about the place, the appointments
of which were poor.</p>

<p>She sat bolt upright, looking into the face she had
instantly recognized, and the detective stood for a
moment at the door.</p>

<p>“You don’t want me, I hope?” asked the woman.</p>

<p>“Not at all, Sybil.”</p>

<p>“That’s good, but I couldn’t see how you would,
seeing that I’ve been good for three years.”</p>

<p>“I know that, and you’re to have all the credit,
too.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Carter. But if you had come a
little sooner you might have seen an old friend,” and
the woman laughed.</p>

<p>“What old friend was here, Sybil?”</p>

<p>“It was Mag. You remember her?”</p>

<p>In spite of his coolness the detective started.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued the woman called Sybil, “Mag was
here, and bade me good-by. She’s going off. What’s
happened, Mr. Carter? Mag wouldn’t explain.”</p>

<p>“Where did she go, Sybil?” asked the detective,
paying no attention to the woman’s query.</p>

<p>“She did not tell me. But I never saw Mag in just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
the way she was. She said she was tired of life, tired
of pulling other people’s chestnuts out of the fire, and
now and then she acted like a person on the verge of
insanity. She may have gone to the river, for once or
twice she mentioned it in despairing tones.”</p>

<p>“How long has she been gone?” eagerly questioned
the detective.</p>

<p>“Barely twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see you later, Sybil,” cried the detective, turning
to the door. “I must find Mag, if possible.”</p>

<p>“She’s Nora now, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p>“She dropped ‘Mag’ months ago, or soon after she
came down the river.”</p>

<p>“But she’s Mag yet,” smiled Carter, and in another
second the woman was left alone wondering why he
wanted to see Nora so badly.</p>

<p>There were many chances against Nick finding the
woman he sought, but he did not despair.</p>

<p>The piers of New York are many and long.</p>

<p>From them thousands have leaped to their death, or
been thrown into the waters after dark by those whose
hands are red with crime.</p>

<p>More than once the detective’s trail had taken him
to the docks, and there he had picked up more than
one clew.</p>

<p>Every dock in the city was known to Carter.</p>

<p>While among them he was at home, and knew where
they began and ended.</p>

<p>The bare thought that this old criminal had gone to
the river in a fit of remorse, for he doubted not that
she thought Margie had perished in the fire, urged
him on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>Of course, if Nora intended to commit suicide she
had had ample time to carry out her plans, but still
there was a chance that she had changed her mind.</p>

<p>The detective reached the river at a spot nearest the
house he had just left.</p>

<p>He could see nothing of the hunted woman, and no
crowd such as gathers on the piers when the body of
a suicide has been discovered greeted him.</p>

<p>The detective walked along the river front for some
distance with his senses on the alert.</p>

<p>All at once he caught sight of something floating
in the water, and he stopped suddenly and leaned forward.</p>

<p>It did not take him long to see that the object was
the body of a woman, and Carter called a policeman
who stood a short distance away.</p>

<p>“That’s the same woman!” cried the patrolman the
moment he caught sight of the body.</p>

<p>“What woman?” asked Carter.</p>

<p>“Why, sir, the woman who came down here three
hours ago and asked me some fool questions about the
river.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice which way she went. But that’s
her.”</p>

<p>Nick and the policeman managed to bring the body
against the logs of the pier, and the detective clambered
down and hauled it up.</p>

<p>The burden was a heavy one, but the detective’s hand
did not lose its grip, and in time the body lay on the
wharf, which it drenched.</p>

<p>The detective looked into the long face, and his gaze
alighted upon a little scar over the left eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“This is Nora—Margie’s jaileress, but she’s Mag
Maginnis, the old offender. She’s not to blame entirely
for this. The hand of her master drove her to suicide,
and he shall pay for it!”</p>

<p>Carter seemed to speak the last words through
clenched teeth, and his voice told that he meant every
word he said.</p>

<p>The policeman in the meantime called the patrol,
and Nick had extracted from the woman’s bosom a
little flat package like a memorandum, which he hastily
transferred to his own pocket.</p>

<p>“That’s the end of one poor, storm-tossed soul,”
muttered the detective as he walked away. “I found
Mag sooner than I expected, but we’ve not heard the
last of her.”</p>

<p>Half a block from the river front the detective
nearly ran against a man who came out of a house with
a reputation none of the best and walked off.</p>

<p>The walk and the well-known shoulders as revealed
by the man caused a light of recognition to leap up
into Carter’s eyes, and his gaze followed the fellow
some distance.</p>

<p>“What brought you to the scene of Nora’s death,
Claude Lamont?” mentally queried the man of clews.
“Did you have to hound the poor creature to the last
terrible act of her life?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />

<small>A FAIR FOE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The detective followed the young man until he lost
him beyond the doors of a well-known café, and then
he turned away.</p>

<p>Nora, alias Mag Maginnis, had ended her life in
the cold waters of the river, and the detective believed
that Claude Lamont was morally responsible.</p>

<p>“Now for another visit to the lion’s den,” said Carter,
as he made his way to another part of the city and
rang the bell attached to the millionaire’s mansion.</p>

<p>It was not the hour for a social call, but he found
the money king at home. He had not forgotten his
former visit, when he was faced by the daughter and
warned not to carry his hunt too far.</p>

<p>Carter still saw the fine figure of the girl before
him and her flashing eyes, but she had not deterred
him.</p>

<p>He was shown at once to the library, and Perry
Lamont turned his chair so as to face the detective.</p>

<p>“What is it, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p>Before Carter could reply the door opened and the
daughter, Opal, came in.</p>

<p>Opal Lamont was handsome, with a fine figure and
a bright face; but her eyes seemed full of fire, and
unnatural fire at that.</p>

<p>Spying the detective, she advanced haughtily and
faced him.</p>

<p>“Are you going to hold an interview with this
man?” she asked her father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>“I presume he is here to see me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll remain,” answered Opal, and the next moment
she dropped into a chair and turned her face to the
detective.</p>

<p>Her manner was positive, if not insulting, and the
detective swallowed it mutely.</p>

<p>Perry Lamont seemed rejoiced to have his daughter
beside him.</p>

<p>It made him look triumphantly at Carter, and for a
moment a smile of victory appeared at his mouth.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, we’ll proceed,” he said. “Your mission
here you can make known and we will listen.”</p>

<p>“You remember that I am on the trail of the person
who killed Mother Flintstone?”</p>

<p>“I remember.”</p>

<p>“You remember, too, begging the young lady’s pardon,
that the old lady was your near kin.”</p>

<p>These words were like a spark to a magazine, and
the next moment Opal broke forth:</p>

<p>“It’s the same old blackmailing scheme, father. You
shall not listen to it.”</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, Miss Lamont——”</p>

<p>“I am calm enough now. You shall not introduce
such subjects in this house. We do not recognize the
old hag who was killed, perhaps righteously, in the
place called Hell’s Kitchen. You must talk about another
matter if you want to remain here.”</p>

<p>Perry Lamont looked crushed and almost helpless
in his chair.</p>

<p>He glanced at his daughter, and then toward the
door leading into the hall.</p>

<p>“Where’s Claude?” he asked.</p>

<p>“He is not in just now,” answered Opal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>“No, sir,” put in the detective. “Your son just now
is not in; but I could enlighten you as to his whereabouts.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been playing spy, have you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been following the trail of one who has been
your brother’s friend, miss.”</p>

<p>Opal Lamont colored and for half a second remained
silent.</p>

<p>“It is blackmail all the same,” she resumed at last.
“In the first place, whatever that old woman was to
us we don’t intend to be bled.”</p>

<p>“I believe you once offered me ten thousand dollars
not to pursue this trail, miss.”</p>

<p>“I did it for his sake,” and she nodded toward her
father. “I don’t want his nerves shattered.”</p>

<p>The detective glanced at Perry Lamont and pitied
the abject old figure in the chair.</p>

<p>“They looked alike,” was all he said, with a glance
at Miss Opal.</p>

<p>The daughter curled her lip and looked away.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” she said. “My day will come, Mr.
Detective.”</p>

<p>Carter turned once more to the millionaire and said:</p>

<p>“I’ll state my business. I am here to ask you
about that contract.”</p>

<p>Lamont started.</p>

<p>“What contract?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The one you made with your son.”</p>

<p>There was a cry and a sudden start, and the millionaire
nearly fell from his chair.</p>

<p>“I made no contract!” he cried.</p>

<p>“None whatever?”</p>

<p>“None!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>“You did not promise him a large sum if he would
put a certain person out of the way?”</p>

<p>“I did not.”</p>

<p>“That’s blackmail, pure and simple,” flashed Opal
Lamont. “You cannot succeed.”</p>

<p>She arose and crossed the room.</p>

<p>Perry Lamont seemed to grovel in his chair.</p>

<p>“You deny the contract, do you?” queried the detective.</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“He never lies!” exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>“And never forgets, eh?”</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>“Then his mind is greatly at fault this minute. Let
me ask another question.”</p>

<p>“Not another one! He has been questioned enough.
Don’t you see you have excited him?”</p>

<p>“Not so much but that he can answer intelligently.
Perry Lamont, your sister did not die heirless.”</p>

<p>“My God!”</p>

<p>“She left some of her blood behind. She did not
pass out of the world at the hand of the assassin without
leaving behind some one who has a right to her
name!”</p>

<p>The look of the millionaire became a stare, and his
hand shook as he laid it upon the desk before him.</p>

<p>“Come!” cried Opal. “Must we really buy your
silence?”</p>

<p>“It is not in the market, miss, as I have once told
you. I want to reach the solution of this terrible
crime. I shall not turn from the trail till I am at the
end of it. Mother Flintstone’s blood calls for revenge,
and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>Opal, who stood beside her father, leaned over him
and whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>The old man’s face brightened.</p>

<p>“Not another word till I come back,” continued the
girl to her parent, and with this she left the room.</p>

<p>Two minutes later her steps were heard at the door
across the room and once more she stood before Nick.</p>

<p>In that short time she had gowned herself for the
street, and, stepping to one side, she touched a button.</p>

<p>“We are going out,” said she, looking at the detective.
“I have just ordered the carriage.”</p>

<p>The detective looked amazed.</p>

<p>Going out with that girl?</p>

<p>The turn of affairs actually amused him.</p>

<p>“I want you to accompany me to a certain place,”
continued Opal Lamont. “We shall not be there long;
but you must go with me.”</p>

<p>The detective consented, and in a few moments they
entered the carriage which had come to the front door.</p>

<p>Opal had drawn a spotted veil over her face and had
fallen back into the depths of the vehicle saying nothing,
although addressed by the detective.</p>

<p>The coachman seemed to know where to go.</p>

<p>Carter had not heard the girl give him any orders,
but he turned corner after corner, as if his destination
was plain to him.</p>

<p>For at least ten minutes the vehicle bounced over
the stones, and then it halted in front of a two-story
brick house in the lower part of Gotham.</p>

<p>The detective looked out, and took in the contour
of the house, and Opal opened the door of the cab.</p>

<p>“We’re here,” she said, speaking for the first time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
since leaving home, and in a moment she dismounted,
to be followed by the nonplused detective.</p>

<p>The millionaire’s daughter led the way up the steps,
and with a key opened the front door.</p>

<p>As she threw it back she motioned to the detective
to enter, and Carter soon stood in a fireless parlor
darkened by heavy curtains at the windows.</p>

<p>“I’ll see you in a moment,” said Opal, rushing toward
the door, and the detective heard the sound of
leather and silk on the stairs.</p>

<p>“This is a queer adventure,” thought Carter. “This
must be one of the many houses Perry Lamont owns.
The young woman is a cool-headed thing and seems to
have the nerves her father has lost. Why has she
brought me to this place? What new mystery is this?
Ah! here she comes!”</p>

<p>There were footsteps in the hall, and the detective
watched the door.</p>

<p>But the sounds did not seem to come all the way
down the flight; they appeared to stop midway, and
the detective glanced up at the open transom.</p>

<p>The sight he saw there riveted him to the spot.</p>

<p>Leaning over the banisters was Opal Lamont, but
how changed.</p>

<p>Her face was as white as a sheet, and her lips were
welded like pieces of steel.</p>

<p>The hat had been discarded, and her long hair fell
in uncombed masses over her shoulder.</p>

<p>The girl looked like an avenging spirit, and the
detective thought he had never seen a face just like
hers.</p>

<p>The whole thing appeared more visionary than real;
it seemed some hideous dream in which he was to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
the victim, but that it was terrible reality the detective
soon discovered.</p>

<p>The lips sprang apart suddenly, and Nick heard the
voice of the creature on the stairs.</p>

<p>“I hardly expected to trap you so easily,” she said,
in sharp, triumphant tones. “You fell into the snare
like a tenderfoot. Did you think I was about to reveal
something to you? Your time has come! I hold death
in my hand, and I haven’t practiced at the pistol galleries
for nothing.”</p>

<p>Carter saw the revolver which Opal Lamont thrust
forward; he tried to spring to the door, but some
unseen agency seemed to root him to the carpet. Then
came a flash, leaping tigerlike through the transom, as
it seemed—then darkness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX.<br />

<small>THE BACK TRAIL.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>All this time the carriage which had carried Opal
and Carter to the house had waited for the girl just
around the nearest corner.</p>

<p>When Opal emerged from the place no excitement
was noticed about her.</p>

<p>She walked as gayly as if she had not sent a man
to his doom, and when she stepped into the carriage
there was a smile on her lips.</p>

<p>She knew what she had done, and the secret was
hers.</p>

<p>The vehicle went straight to the Lamont mansion,
and the girl dismissed it at the door.</p>

<p>She entered the house and passed directly to her
room on one of the upper floors, where she changed
her gown; then she descended to the library, where
she had left her father.</p>

<p>She found him in the same position at the desk as
if he had not stirred since her departure.</p>

<p>He met her eye the moment she entered the room,
and she came forward, saying nothing.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you back, Opal. Did you get rid
of that man?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You did not let him blackmail you?”</p>

<p>“I did not.”</p>

<p>“You did not——”</p>

<p>Perry Lamont stopped as if he was on dangerous
ground, but Opal could not avoid his gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>Her eyes seemed to betray her.</p>

<p>“You surely did not——” began the millionaire
again, but stopped as before.</p>

<p>“Never mind where he is,” put in Opal. “I’m quite
sure Nick Carter will not give us any more trouble.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. I’m glad to hear you say that, and
your manner convinces me that it is so. I trust he
didn’t give you any trouble, child?”</p>

<p>“None in the least. There, don’t bother about that
man. He’s out of the way; won’t trouble you any
more.”</p>

<p>Opal arose and swept from the room, the eyes of the
nabob following her with mute questioning.</p>

<p>He heard her on the floor above, and closed his eyes
as he leaned back in the chair.</p>

<p>Did he suspect the truth?</p>

<p>Did the rich man dream that his child had handled
a revolver within the last hour, and that she had aimed
at a man’s breast?</p>

<p>If he thought of such things he made no sign.</p>

<p>It was some hours after these events that the door
of the library was opened and Claude, his son, came in.</p>

<p>Lamont was now fast asleep, and the young sport
watched him for ten minutes.</p>

<p>Stealing over to the desk, Claude opened a drawer
near his father’s hand and extracted a large envelope
therefrom.</p>

<p>As he was transferring it to his pocket Opal looked
into the room, and then came forward.</p>

<p>“Don’t awaken him,” she said. “I want to see you,
Claude. Come across the hall.”</p>

<p>“Mother——”</p>

<p>“Mother won’t hear us, for she is lying down overhead.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
Come with me. I didn’t know you were in the
house.”</p>

<p>“I just came in.”</p>

<p>“Good.”</p>

<p>The pair left the library and crossed the hall to the
darkened parlor, where Opal turned suddenly on her
brother.</p>

<p>“Have you done it yet?” she asked.</p>

<p>Claude started in spite of himself.</p>

<p>“Done what?”</p>

<p>“You know. I happened to overhear you and father.
Have you finished him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do. You know about the two hundred
thousand. You were to get the confession, besides
silencing him.”</p>

<p>“I’ve done nothing yet. I understand now,” said
Claude, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>“When will you?”</p>

<p>“Just as soon as I get a chance.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you’re putting it off too long?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’m doing my best.”</p>

<p>“But while he lives and keeps the confession written
in Hell’s Kitchen it will be against us.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You’re his chum. You know where he nests, and
you are the proper person to silence this man with the
terrible secret. You’re not afraid of the law, are
you?”</p>

<p>Again Claude Lamont started and looked down into
the flushed face of his sister.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not afraid of that, but you see I can’t
strike till I have a fair target.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“I know that.”</p>

<p>“There is that bothersome detective,” suggested
Claude.</p>

<p>“Never mind him,” laughed Opal; “he’s silenced.”</p>

<p>“Since when?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask too many questions. He’s silenced, I
say.”</p>

<p>“I guess not. I’ve seen him lately.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got later news than that!” cried the young
girl. “I’m right from the seat of war, so to speak.”</p>

<p>Claude wanted to ask further questions, but she
stopped him by laying her hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“That man was an enemy of us all,” she said. “He
was dangerous, Claude.”</p>

<p>“Positively so,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“He was a living menace to our future happiness;
he was as dangerous as this man Richmond, your
friend, and his confession. I shuddered whenever I
thought of Nick Carter, who would not let me buy
him off.”</p>

<p>“He was incorruptible, was he?” laughed Claude.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he’s fixed now.”</p>

<p>“With whose money, Opal? Father’s?”</p>

<p>“With something that silences better than gold,”
was the startling answer. “I would never face him
the second time with a bribe. I know what’s what.”</p>

<p>“See here. You’ve got me on nettles. What’s become
of this man? I demand to know?”</p>

<p>Opal thought a moment, and then turned her head
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>“When have you been to the Cedar Street house?”
she asked, without looking at him.</p>

<p>“Not in six months.”</p>

<p>“Here’s the key. Go and look inside.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! there’s nothing there for me.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what’s there, since you confess
that you haven’t crossed its threshold in six months.”</p>

<p>“If you tell me the secret I won’t have to make the
trip.”</p>

<p>“Go and find it.” Opal pushed her brother away.
“I want to make sure of a certain thing.”</p>

<p>“I see. You’ve been to the Cedar Street house.”</p>

<p>Opal gave him a knowing look, and again pushed
him toward the door.</p>

<p>“I’ll go, hang me if I don’t!” he exclaimed. “I say,
sis, if you’ve intrusted a secret to that house it ought
to be safe, for it hasn’t been tenanted for half a year.
Into which part of it shall I look?”</p>

<p>“In the first room to the right.”</p>

<p>“The old-fashioned parlor, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there, there!” cried the millionaire’s child.
“God forgive me, Claude, I couldn’t help it. I had
him in the snare.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later Claude Lamont stood on the sidewalk
in front of his home.</p>

<p>“In creation’s name, what does sis mean?” he asked
himself. “What has she been doing in that old house?
Something desperate, I’ll bet my head.”</p>

<p>He walked to the first corner, where he took a
passing car and rode downtown.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he left it, and proceeded to
Cedar Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>The millionaire owned half a dozen houses there, but
the one designated by Opal was the best of all.</p>

<p>With the key supplied by his sister, the city sport
let himself into the house and shut the door carefully
behind him.</p>

<p>Then he made his way to the first room on the right
of the hall and opened its portal.</p>

<p>It was quite dark, all the curtains down—Lamont
kept his untenanted houses already furnished—and
Claude had to strike a match.</p>

<p>“Jehu! what did sis mean, anyhow?” he exclaimed,
as the light flickered up. “No one here.”</p>

<p>He held the lucifer above his head and took a survey
of the parlor.</p>

<p>Everything seemed in place, and he looked everywhere
as he moved about the room.</p>

<p>He noticed that the transom over the hall door was
wide open, but he thought nothing of this.</p>

<p>The faintest odor of burned powder assailed his
nostrils and he stood in the middle of the room a few
seconds and sniffed the air.</p>

<p>“The girl’s mad!” he suddenly cried. “What is the
fool’s errand she wanted me to attend to, I’d like to
know? There’s nothing in this room, and yet she
wanted me to look nowhere else but in this chamber.
There’s the smell of powder here. What does it mean?
She was here, she admitted. She can shoot like a
professional. I’ve seen her at it in the gallery. I’ll
have to go back and laugh at her foolery.”</p>

<p>Claude quitted the room, and, to make sure there
was nothing out of the way in the house, went all
over it.</p>

<p>“Sis is out of her head,” he again exclaimed, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
he had inspected the last room. “She may have thought
she trapped the detective, but she did nothing of the
kind.”</p>

<p>When he left the Cedar Street house it was to go
straight home.</p>

<p>He peeped into the library, but his father was no
longer there.</p>

<p>“You?” cried a person who came out of the shadows
of the bookcases, and Claude Lamont stood in the
presence of Opal.</p>

<p>Her look was a question, but her lips framed one.</p>

<p>“You’ve been there?” she cried.</p>

<p>“You sent me down there, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I did. Well?”</p>

<p>“I always obey you, don’t I, sis?”</p>

<p>“You do, Claude. You are my best friend. But tell
me—you looked into the room on the right?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And——”</p>

<p>“It was empty!”</p>

<p>“Empty? My God!” and Opal, the millionaire’s
daughter, staggered back and dropped into her father’s
chair.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX.<br />

<small>THE MASTER DETECTIVE’S LITTLE GAME.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Empty? That house?” again cried Opal, from the
depths of the chair. “I cannot believe it.”</p>

<p>“It is true. I just came from the place,” answered
Claude. “What did you do there, sis?”</p>

<p>“I shot him.”</p>

<p>“Not the detective?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Carter. I lured him to the place. He was
here again, playing his hand. I could not stand it. He
was in our way. I wanted him removed. Father was
helpless, and the desperate scheme came into my head.
I lured him to the Cedar Street house and leaned over
the banister, shooting him through the transom while
he stood in the parlor.”</p>

<p>“And left him there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, he wasn’t there when I looked into the room.”
Opal Lamont looked wildly around the library.</p>

<p>“What could have become of him?” she asked.</p>

<p>Claude shook his head.</p>

<p>“Do you think he could not have been dead?”</p>

<p>“I thought you went into the parlor afterward?”</p>

<p>“I did. I bent over him.”</p>

<p>“And he appeared at the end of the trail?”</p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>“It’s a mystery to me.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you look all over the house?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I did.”</p>

<p>Opal sat silent for a moment longer, and then she
sprang up with a sharp cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>“If he lives he will try to get even. We must
silence this man. It must be done at once.”</p>

<p>“Granted. You were a fool to decoy him to the
old house.”</p>

<p>“I knew of no other place,” was the reply. “I took
the first plan that entered my head. I never dreamed
of failure.”</p>

<p>“There, don’t think I’m finding fault, sis. You did
the best you could; I’m sure of that. The only wonder
is that you didn’t make a sure shot after what you’ve
done at the galleries.”</p>

<p>Half an hour after the interview with his sister
Claude Lamont occupied the armchair in the room
in which he once showed himself to Carter and Bristol
Clara, the latter his near neighbor.</p>

<p>This time he was alone.</p>

<p>Presently he was startled by a rap on the front
door, as if some one outside had no use for a bell, and
in a moment he had opened it.</p>

<p>He found a well-dressed, dark-faced stranger on the
step—a man with a brownish beard and clear, gray
eyes.</p>

<p>Claude did not know just what to do with the man,
but as he held the door open the fellow entered and
faced him in the hall.</p>

<p>“Come this way if you have business with me,” said
the city sport, and he escorted his caller to the room
he had just left.</p>

<p>The man took a chair and laid his hat on his knees.</p>

<p>“To whom am I indebted for this call?” asked
Claude.</p>

<p>“Call me Hugh Larkins,” answered the stranger, in
a squeakish voice that made a sound almost like a file.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>“I don’t know you, Mr. Larkins.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. You don’t remember me. You have
forgotten all about the old place on the Bowery that
flourished five or six years ago. You don’t recall the
barkeeper and the sometime pianist?”</p>

<p>A smile flitted across Claude’s face.</p>

<p>“Are you that person?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’m Hugh Larkins. Sometimes they call me ‘Rosy’
Larkins, you remember.”</p>

<p>“I never recall nicknames.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Lamont, you’ve got good quarters here.”</p>

<p>Claude started a little at mention of his name.</p>

<p>“You see, I know you. Why, you haven’t changed
a great deal. You’ve got a few more years on you,
and you’ve grown a little stouter—good living, I guess.
The ‘Daisy Chain’ isn’t running now, I believe. I
dropped into the old place this morning, but the piano
stopped four years ago and the hole is a poor bucket
shop at present.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Claude.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Lamont, let’s to business. I’m a little
hard up—somewhat desperate, to make use of a homely
phrase.”</p>

<p>“And you think I’m a nabob when it comes to cash,
eh?”</p>

<p>“I know you’re not Lazarus. I’ve got to have a
little chink to keep the proverbial wolf from the door,
and——”</p>

<p>“My dear sir, you’ve struck the wrong place,” broke
in Claude. “I can’t accommodate you.”</p>

<p>Larkins fell back in his chair and seemed at his
wits’ end.</p>

<p>“That’s bad,” he suddenly squeaked. “It nearly puts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
me into the river—a desperate man’s last resort, you
see.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help that,” said Claude coldly. “Every man
can do as he pleases with his anatomy, and if you
see fit to immerse yours, why, I can’t object.”</p>

<p>“You can’t help Rosy Larkins, who used to play
for you at the Daisy Chain? You can’t give the old
beau a lift?”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t stop with you,” was the reply. “It
wouldn’t stop with you, Rosy.”</p>

<p>“I’m but the advance guard, eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s it.”</p>

<p>Rosy Larkins appeared to get upon his feet with
difficulty. He looked down at Claude Lamont and
seemed to study him a minute.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll have to sell it,” said he.</p>

<p>In spite of himself the millionaire’s son lost a little
color.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to sell what?” he asked.</p>

<p>“What I know!”</p>

<p>“See here, that’s an old game,” cried Claude. “It’s
a rascal’s last resort. You can’t blackmail me.”</p>

<p>“But I can sell what I know—to the police.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know anything.”</p>

<p>“Do you dare me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Larkins crossed the room, but stopped at the door,
the knob of which he held in his hand.</p>

<p>“You wasn’t in the old place that night? Oh, no.
You wasn’t in Hell’s Kitchen a few nights ago? You
never go to such a disreputable place? Certainly not.
The son of Perry Lamont never goes to such places.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
Why, of course he doesn’t. Hell’s Kitchen? Why,
there’s where Mother Flintstone lived—and died, I
believe.”</p>

<p>Claude said nothing.</p>

<p>He looked as if his tongue had become riveted to his
palate; his eyes seemed to bulge from his head, and
his hand dropped from the table at his right.</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t go to Hell’s Kitchen, because
you say you don’t,” grinned Rosy Larkins in the
same squeaky tones.</p>

<p>“What are you driving at?” at last Claude made
out to say.</p>

<p>“At just what I’ve said. I’m pretty plain. My voice
isn’t as sweet as the notes of the oriole, but you understand
my words all the same.”</p>

<p>“You certainly don’t mean to say that you’ve got a
secret about my going to Hell’s Kitchen?”</p>

<p>“Now you’ve hit it. You wasn’t there the night
Mother Flintstone was helped out of this world?”</p>

<p>“I was not.”</p>

<p>“But I know better.”</p>

<p>“You do?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you were there, and Rosy Larkins holds the
secret so far all alone.”</p>

<p>Claude leaned forward and fastened his gaze upon
the face before him.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think silence is worth a thousand dollars?”
queried his caller.</p>

<p>“Your silence?”</p>

<p>“Mine! That’s not a large sum with you who has
his hands upon the purse strings of a millionaire. You
don’t want the police to drag you forward as being
connected with the mystery of Hell’s Kitchen? I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
don’t want to see one of my old patrons in such a
fix.”</p>

<p>“Did you see me there?” asked Claude, a little
nervously.</p>

<p>“I’ve got convincing proof.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t got the money, Larkins. You will
have to come again.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” said Larkins, and the squeak seemed to
get the snarl of a wild beast.</p>

<p>Claude looked at the table and then back at the
man.</p>

<p>Larkins was twirling his hat on one of his hands,
and his face was still immobile.</p>

<p>“What if I can’t raise that amount, and then, what
does a man of your present standing want with a
thousand dollars?”</p>

<p>“What does a porcupine want with his quills?”
flashed the young sport’s visitor. “He uses them, that’s
what. I can use a thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>Lamont thought of his own account in bank.</p>

<p>It would not do to give that man a check for the
amount, for identification might be followed with unpleasant
recollections.</p>

<p>Suddenly he thought of the five thousand he had
lately received from Lamont, senior.</p>

<p>A part of it was still in his pocket.</p>

<p>Biting his lips Claude produced the roll of bills
and slowly counted out the required amount.</p>

<p>“There, don’t come again,” he said, looking up at
Larkins, whose hand reached out for the money. “But
hold on. What assurance have I that you won’t sell
me out yet?”</p>

<p>“My word.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“If it’s no better than your face I’m afraid it’s not
worth a great deal.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I’m no seraph. Neither was
Mother Flintstone, who died that night—you know
how,” and with this shaft Rosy Larkins opened the
door.</p>

<p>As he stepped into the hall his face was for a moment
turned from Claude, and that moment the young
man whipped a revolver from the table drawer.</p>

<p>As he started up there was a musical click, but the
next instant the bare hand of Larkins covered him.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool,” he said. “The secret wouldn’t
die with me, Mr. Lamont.”</p>

<p>The leveled weapon dropped and Claude went back
again.</p>

<p>“Aha, good-by. Thanks for the chink. It saves
Rosy Larkins from the river,” and the man with the
squeaky voice was gone.</p>

<p>He went from the scene of the interview almost
straight to Mulberry Street; he entered police headquarters
and made his way to the superintendent’s
private office, where he handed the roll of money to a
young man.</p>

<p>“Lock it up,” said he. “We’ll talk about it later.
I’m rather tired of this beard,” and Carter immediately
stood revealed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI.<br />

<small>IN MOTHER FLINTSTONE’S DEN AGAIN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The day following these exciting events George
Richmond might have been seen bending over a manuscript
in a small room some distance from Claude
Lamont’s apartments.</p>

<p>He had been diligently at work upon the document
for some hours, now and then refreshing himself from
a bottle on the table.</p>

<p>The chirography was not his own.</p>

<p>It looked for all the world like the writing of an old
person taken with the palsy, and the man at work
smiled every now and then as he looked at his job.</p>

<p>“It’s good for the two hundred thousand,” said he,
half aloud. “That was a cute bargain Claude made
with the old nabob. I am to vanish, of course; but
I’ll see that I don’t lose any of my share. I am to be
killed off, and this paper is to fall into Lamont’s hands,
to be consigned of course to the flames. He’ll probably
consider it cheap at two hundred thousand, but I’ll
take care that Claude doesn’t really carry out the bargain.”</p>

<p>The day had deepened into night, and still George
Richmond worked.</p>

<p>He did not stop till the nearest clock struck eight,
and then he finished his self-imposed task.</p>

<p>Once more, like a good accountant, he glanced over
his pages and stuffed them into an old envelope prepared
for the occasion.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” he remarked. “Now for the proof
of my demise, ha, ha!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>He thrust the whole into his pocket and buttoned his
coat over it.</p>

<p>After this he turned the gas low and filled the room
with shadows, then pulled his soft hat over his forehead
and left the house.</p>

<p>He did not know that he was seen to quit the place.</p>

<p>He was not aware of the fact that during the last
part of his work a pair of foxlike eyes were watching
him through a rent in the curtain, thanks to a broken
slat in the shutter.</p>

<p>The owner of these eyes was on his trail.</p>

<p>It was a boy, shrewd and wiry, and he kept George
Richmond in sight, no matter how many turns he
made.</p>

<p>Mulberry Billy had not played spy upon this man
for nothing.</p>

<p>While he could not see the writing, he felt that it
was for no good, and thus he slipped after the man as
he crossed one street after another, taking himself
into a strange part of New York.</p>

<p>George Richmond visited a well-known cheap café
on the Bowery and had a plain supper, after which,
once more buttoning his coat to his chin, he sauntered
out under the lights.</p>

<p>Billy was still his ferret.</p>

<p>The boy tracked the man to the house occupied at
times by Claude Lamont.</p>

<p>He saw him mount the steps, but could not see beyond
the door.</p>

<p>George Richmond entered the library and turned on
the light.</p>

<p>There he looked around the room, but did not see
any one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>Claude was not at home.</p>

<p>Richmond would have started if he could have seen
the woman who all the time was closely watching him.</p>

<p>Bristol Clara, Carter’s friend, was on the alert, and,
having seen him come in, was looking at him through
the secret crack.</p>

<p>All at once Richmond started up.</p>

<p>“What a fool I am,” he said. “Why didn’t I think
of it before? I forgot to look under the hearth—the
very place an old woman like her would hide precious
papers.”</p>

<p>He threw a hasty glance toward the door and was
about to quit the house when he heard a step.</p>

<p>In another moment Claude Lamont stood before
him.</p>

<p>“I’ve been waiting for you,” said Richmond.</p>

<p>“And I’ve been unavoidably detained. Couldn’t get
here sooner. Well, have you got the papers?”</p>

<p>Richmond produced his work and threw the bundle
upon the table.</p>

<p>Claude pounced upon it and ran over the documents.</p>

<p>“This is good. I didn’t know it was in you,” he
cried, looking up at Richmond.</p>

<p>“I’ve been trained in more schools than one,” was
the answer, and Claude looked away.</p>

<p>“Does it suit?” asked Richmond.</p>

<p>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p>“Will it deceive the governor?”</p>

<p>“Of course it will. Now you must vanish.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m to ‘die’ to his satisfaction. I believe you
can’t draw any more money till I’m out of the way
and the ‘confession’ in your father’s hands.”</p>

<p>“That’s the bargain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“Well, I thought of that and dashed off this.”</p>

<p>Another bit of paper fell on the table and Claude
read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">“FATAL ACCIDENT.</p>

<p>“Last night at ten o’clock a man was seen to fall
on the street near the Brussel Block, on Broadway.
His companion, apparently frightened by his fall,
hastened away, leaving his friend on the pavement.
It was discovered that the stricken man was a well-known
character named George Richmond, who of
late has been subject to attacks of vertigo. The unfortunate
man was conveyed from the spot by others
who happened to know him, and taken to the rooms of
a friend, where he died. Richmond once did time, but
of late has not done anything that called for his
arrest, though he was known as a shady character,
liable to embark on some scheme that promised to add
to his wealth, no matter how questionable the transaction.”</p>
</div>

<p>“That’s good!” exclaimed Claude Lamont. “You’re
dead—as dead as a doornail, and please have the kindness
to keep this in view. I don’t think you could have
done better. Now, what newspaper?”</p>

<p>“I’ve made the proper arrangements. You can take
it to the <i>Item</i>. It will cost one hundred to get it inserted,
but that’s all right. It’s dirt cheap.”</p>

<p>Claude placed the writing in his pocket and smiled.</p>

<p>“It will hoodwink the old man nicely. He won’t
want other ‘proof.’”</p>

<p>“I thought not.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see to that. Now I’ll attend to the matter. I
understand that the item is to appear in but the one
paper, and in but one copy at that.”</p>

<p>“That’s it. Too promiscuous publishing might spoil
our plans.” The two men arose and left the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>On the outside the same little figure saw them and
again became Carter’s spy.</p>

<p>This time Billy tracked Claude Lamont, and saw
him enter the office of a morning newspaper with a
limited circulation.</p>

<p>He saw him in earnest conversation with a certain
attaché of the office, and some money changed hands.</p>

<p>After this Claude Lamont, as Billy found out,
seemed quite at ease, for he followed him to a large
café, where he ate heartily like a man pleased with
what he had done.</p>

<p>Meantime George Richmond had gone to another
part of the city.</p>

<p>Once more he entered the locality known in the
annals of the police as Hell’s Kitchen, and slipped
into the room once occupied by Mother Flintstone.</p>

<p>The people who had moved into the place were
already gone, a few hours sufficing, and he was alone
in the old shell.</p>

<p>Instead of sounding walls and ceiling, as he had
done on a former visit, he went straight to the old
bricks on the hearth, and commenced lifting them one
by one.</p>

<p>To accomplish his purpose the more readily he got
down on his knees and worked like a beaver.</p>

<p>Each brick was carefully replaced, and he had gone
over half the space when he was interrupted.</p>

<p>A door opened and shut behind him, and George
Richmond started to his feet.</p>

<p>A man stood before him.</p>

<p>“There, don’t draw,” said the person at the door.
“It would do you no good, George Richmond. Don’t
let me disturb you. Go back to your work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>Richmond did not stir.</p>

<p>“Go back to your work, I say. I’ll wait till you
find it.”</p>

<p>“Find what?”</p>

<p>“You know. Your quest.”</p>

<p>The ex-convict smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“I was only seeing if the old woman placed anything
under the bricks,” said he.</p>

<p>“Something valuable, eh?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Not money, was it, George?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not.”</p>

<p>“You’re a cool one. I thought your trip up the
river reformed you. Don’t you remember how the
newspapers exploited your return, and said you were
quit of crime? It was a great fake, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>The speaker smiled, but Richmond did not.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“That’s another matter. Don’t let me disturb you.
You haven’t taken up more than half the bricks. Go
through the rest.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to. You’re playing spy, and, by
heavens! that’s dangerous work.”</p>

<p>“You mean that the man who watches you may live
to regret it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well call me spy, then. Don’t you think you’re
playing a pretty bold hand just now, George?”</p>

<p>“I?”</p>

<p>“You. You are into it so deep that you don’t want
to miss a good thing. There’s nothing buried under
those bricks; there never was. Mother Flintstone hid
it elsewhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“That’s false. She hid it in this house, and unless
you——”</p>

<p>“Come, George, don’t show your teeth like a tiger.
It will do you no good. You can’t find the confession,
but the other one will do just as well!”</p>

<p>“What other one?”</p>

<p>It was evident that the question had no sooner left
Richmond’s lips than he regretted the utterance.</p>

<p>“You know; therefore I need not specify. I hope the
work was well done.”</p>

<p>“Devil! you’ve got to fight for your life,” and the
next instant George Richmond darted forward like a
mad beast, and leaping clear of the floor flung himself
upon the stranger.</p>

<p>That person braced himself for the ordeal, and
warded off the initial blow with the dexterity of a
practiced pugilist.</p>

<p>George found himself foiled, but he did not give up.</p>

<p>Again he darted at his enemy, and the pair came
together in a deadly grapple.</p>

<p>Back and forth over the floor they writhed like
wrestlers before an audience; now George obtaining a
little advantage, now the other getting the best of it.</p>

<p>At last Richmond found himself held against the
wall by a grip of iron.</p>

<p>He panted in his adversary’s power.</p>

<p>“But one man ever held me thus before this,” he
cried.</p>

<p>“Who was he?”</p>

<p>“Nick Carter, and, by heavens! you must be that
same man!”</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<small>MULBERRY BILLY’S “FIND.”</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Margie Marne came out of the hospital shortly after
her terrible experience in the house guarded by Nora.</p>

<p>Her escape had bordered on the miraculous, and the
girl was glad to get back to the humble home she occupied.</p>

<p>Her first thought was of the woman who had been
her jaileress and she wondered if Nora herself had
escaped the flames.</p>

<p>Having a fair acquaintance with Billy, the street
Arab, she sought out the boy, and fortunately found
him.</p>

<p>Billy had heard of Nora’s suicide, and he at once
posted Margie.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said the little fellow, “I’ve made a
find.”</p>

<p>“You? What have you discovered, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Something that I am going to show to Mr. Carter
just as soon as I find him.”</p>

<p>“It may amount to nothing.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t know where I found it,” cried the
boy.</p>

<p>“Tell me.”</p>

<p>Billy came closer, and dropped his voice to a whisper
as he laid his hand upon the girl’s arm.</p>

<p>“I found it in Mother Flintstone’s den,” said he.
“Look here, Margie.”</p>

<p>He produced a flat package, which looked like it
had been stored away for years, but the moment the
girl’s eyes alighted on it she uttered a little scream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“It’s the will, Billy!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What had Mother Flintstone to will away, I’d
like to know?” said the boy.</p>

<p>“More than you think. Let me see the packet.”</p>

<p>Billy laid it on the table, and watched Margie closely.</p>

<p>The girl seemed to be afraid to touch the package,
but at last she picked it up.</p>

<p>Opening the envelope, which looked nearly ready to
fall to pieces, she drew forth a paper and opened it.</p>

<p>The first line startled her.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>Margie said nothing, but her eyes dilated.</p>

<p>“It’s a will, you said, Margie?”</p>

<p>“It’s more than that, Billy. It’s the true story of
Mother Flintstone’s life.”</p>

<p>“Then it is important, sure enough.”</p>

<p>Margie read on, her face changing color, and at
last she reached the end of the page.</p>

<p>“Mother Flintstone left behind her an important
document,” she remarked.</p>

<p>“That’s what the dark-faced man was looking for
when he sounded the walls.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of that.”</p>

<p>“P’r’aps that’s why they killed her.”</p>

<p>“They, Billy? Do you think more than one hand
was at work that night?”</p>

<p>“I do, Miss Margie,” cried the boy, confidently.
“There are two hands in this mystery. Mr. Carter will
trip them up in time, see if he don’t.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Billy, there is more than a will,” and Margie
held the package up before the street boy. “As I’ve
told you, it is also the story of Mother Flintstone’s
life. Where did you find it, boy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“Under the hearth.”</p>

<p>“The place was not examined by the dark-faced
man?”</p>

<p>“Exactly! He looked every place else. I found it
there safe from him and the rats. Keep it, Margie.
No, hide it from that man. He’ll have it or your life
if he knows you have it.”</p>

<p>Margie placed the packet in her bosom, and looked
gratefully at the street boy.</p>

<p>“I’ll see that you’re paid for this find,” said she.</p>

<p>“I don’t want a penny. I only want ter get ahead
of George Richmond and his chum, Claude Lamont,
the young sport. They’re into the biggest game of
their lives, but we’ll balk ’em all the same, Margie.”</p>

<p>The girl expressed the hope that it would turn out
thus, and in a short time she was in another part of
the city.</p>

<p>She wanted to avoid the man into whose hands she
had fallen at the Trocadero. She was now confident
that this personage was Claude Lamont himself, and
she had seen enough of his villainy.</p>

<p>Margie Marne carried the precious package home,
where she hid it carefully, believing that no human
eye could find it, and was satisfied.</p>

<p>Night was coming on, and she quitted her humble
lodgings, with her hood pulled over her face so as to
hide it.</p>

<p>She had a visit to make, and soon she reached the
room occupied by Carter.</p>

<p>Her raps were not answered, and she looked disappointed.</p>

<p>When she again reached the street the lamps had
been lit, and the girl looked all about her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>Thinking of the package she started home, but on a
corner not far from Carter’s rooms a hand fell upon
her arm.</p>

<p>Margie started, and uttered a little cry. She looked
around at the same time and into the face of a man,
who leered at her with a half-vicious look.</p>

<p>“Don’t fly so fast, my bird,” laughed the fellow. “I
don’t intend to soil your plumage. You’re Miss Margie
Marne, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“What if I am?”</p>

<p>“Then you’re the very person I want to see.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to see any one.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not. That’s the way with some girls.
I’m Caddy.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Caddy?” demanded Margie.</p>

<p>“I’m the ‘mixer’ at the Trocadero.”</p>

<p>The mention of that name sent a chill through the
girl’s nerves, and she fell back.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention that horrid place!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I know you had a rather unpleasant experience
there, but, you see, it wasn’t my fault. I can tell you
something that may give you a chance to get even.”</p>

<p>“Speak quick, if you can. What is it?”</p>

<p>“Let’s drop in here,” and the little man pointed toward
a decent-looking restaurant.</p>

<p>Eager to learn something more about the man who
had decoyed her to the Trocadero, Margie went with
the fellow, and he guided her to a little table in the
darkest corner of the place.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you bleed him?” were the first words
when they had seated themselves.</p>

<p>“Is that your suggestion? Do you want to make a
blackmailer out of me?” exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“No; it wouldn’t be blackmail in this case,” explained
Caddy. “It would simply be getting pay for
the indignity.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get even with him some other way,” said Margie.
“You know him, do you?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course. Ha, ha, nobody comes to the
Trocadero whom I don’t catch on to. Beat Caddy out
of the game, if you can! You don’t want to make him
pay the fiddler, then?”</p>

<p>“Not in the manner you’ve suggested.”</p>

<p>“You’re a fool!” cried the little man. “See here,
I’ll help you all I can. I’ll go halves with you, and
you won’t have to take any risk. He’ll milk.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not in that business.”</p>

<p>Caddy at once changed color.</p>

<p>His round face became positively hideous.</p>

<p>He leaned across the table like a thoroughbred villain
and his teeth seemed to snap together.</p>

<p>“If you don’t bleed him you’ll get into the net
again,” he suddenly cried.</p>

<p>“Which means, I suppose, that you’ll help get me
there?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say I would, but I won’t help keep you
out.”</p>

<p>Margie flushed.</p>

<p>“You miserable wretch, keep your distance!” she
exclaimed, and would have left the table but for the
clutch of the little man’s hand.</p>

<p>“When you can’t cajole you threaten. It won’t pay,
sir.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see that it does pay!” laughed the mixer of
the Trocadero, unabashed. “I know my business. Sit
down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>Margie was thrust back into her chair, and the
fellow leered at her again.</p>

<p>“If you don’t want to milk the young sport himself,
bleed the old man. He’s a bird with golden plumage.”</p>

<p>“What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“Gad, don’t you know? It’s Perry Lamont. Lives
on one of the avenues and has mints of wealth at his
command. He’s a pigeon worth plucking, girl.”</p>

<p>“No, let others do that.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get your scruples, I’d like to know?”
sneered Caddy. “You’re one in ten thousand. Why,
you can feather your nest in fine shape——”</p>

<p>Margie broke loose from the fellow’s grasp and fell
back.</p>

<p>He arose at the same time and came around the
table.</p>

<p>“Don’t touch me, serpent!” cried the girl. “You
can’t use me in any of your schemes. I try to be
honest.”</p>

<p>“You do, eh? Oh, you’ll get over it in time. Get a
few more years on you and you’ll be as tough——”</p>

<p>“Here, what’s that? That’s an honest girl, sir,” put
in a man eating quietly at another table. “Don’t touch
her, you little sinner, or I’ll break your neck.”</p>

<p>The speaker arose and came forward, gazed at by
Caddy with feelings of fear, while Margie thanked
him mutely for his interference.</p>

<p>“I don’t know you, miss, but I’ve seen this man,”
continued the stranger, who was tall and broad-shouldered.
“I guess it’s not the first time for him. Get
out.”</p>

<p>He pushed Caddy down the aisle with his large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
hand, and the little drink mixer went without much
urging.</p>

<p>“I’ll see you later!” he flashed at Margie.</p>

<p>“No threats!” cried the other man. “Get out, I
say, and the sooner the better.”</p>

<p>Then the tall man turned to Margie and said:</p>

<p>“Pardon me, but I thought I heard him call you
Margie. It cannot be Miss Margie Marne whom I
address?”</p>

<p>“That’s my full name, sir,” said the girl, dropping
her eyes.</p>

<p>“My name is McDonald—Jerry McDonald. I own
a little business property in this city. The man who
just left is a little rascal. I suppose he decoyed you
hither?”</p>

<p>Margie told the story of her coming to the place,
and McDonald said:</p>

<p>“He’s revengeful, and you will do well to look after
him. If you ever need my assistance in any way don’t
hesitate to command it,” and he handed the girl his
card.</p>

<p>In another moment the still astonished girl was
alone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />

<small>THE COST OF A SECRET.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>George Richmond found himself suddenly free from
his antagonist in Mother Flintstone’s den.</p>

<p>The battle ended sooner than he thought, for his
enemy gave a lurch which disengaged them, and when
George recovered he was the sole occupant of the
place.</p>

<p>“Who was he?” the astonished man asked himself.</p>

<p>The reply came from his imagination, and he sprang
to the door and looked out.</p>

<p>No one there.</p>

<p>“I accused him of being Carter, the detective, but
he did not reply,” he went on. “Years ago I was in
Carter’s hands and the grip to-night seemed the same.
But I may have been mistaken. I mustn’t forget that
years have passed since Carter caught me red-handed.
I cannot believe that my foe to-night was the detective.”</p>

<p>George did not resume his inspection of the old
hearth, for he turned away after replacing the last
brick and slipped into the street.</p>

<p>He was to vanish now.</p>

<p>That was his bargain with Claude Lamont, and he
knew that the fictitious account of his death was even
then in the hands of the printers.</p>

<p>He turned up later in another part of the city.</p>

<p>He crossed the bridge and vanished in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Chuckling to himself, he thought of how he had
played it on Perry Lamont.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>In a small room he threw himself upon a couch to
snatch a little sleep.</p>

<p>He was to be pronounced dead by the newspaper to
Perry Lamont.</p>

<p>That was a part of the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Claude, the blackmailer of his own father, was to
attend to that part of the work and he—George—was
to get some of the blood money.</p>

<p>Thinking how easily the game moved onward to success,
he fell asleep, nor waked till the next morning.</p>

<p>Then he set about disguising himself most thoroughly.</p>

<p>He changed his eyebrows, he darkened his hair and
he gave his upper lip a sweeping mustache.</p>

<p>After his work no one would have called him George
Richmond.</p>

<p>Meantime, over in the larger city, Perry Lamont,
entering the library earlier than usual, as if he expected
to hear some news, found Claude there.</p>

<p>Father and son looked at one another for a second,
and Claude pointed at a newspaper on the desk.</p>

<p>The millionaire picked it up and his eager eyes discerned
a pencil mark at a certain paragraph.</p>

<p>He devoured the falsehood eagerly and almost out
of breath.</p>

<p>The young sport watched him like a cat.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” cried Perry Lamont, as he shot
a glance at Claude and dropped into his chair.</p>

<p>“It suits you, I see.”</p>

<p>“Suits me?” was the reply. “You know it does.”</p>

<p>A momentary silence followed between father and
son, and then the elder Lamont said:</p>

<p>“Did you have any trouble?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“Not much.”</p>

<p>“Did he suspect you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did that; but I had to go on, you know.”</p>

<p>“I know. He died for sure?”</p>

<p>It was a singular question, as if the speaker half
suspected the truth, and Claude’s heart seemed to find
a lodgment in his throat.</p>

<p>“What does the paper say?” cried Claude, a little
irritated. “It records the death of the notorious
George Richmond, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It does.”</p>

<p>“That’s sufficient, I think. Do you want to see the—body?”</p>

<p>“My God, no!”</p>

<p>“Nor the burial certificate? They’ll probably hold
a post mortem, but we’re safe all the same. It’s all
right, I assure you. There’s no danger, but it took
work.”</p>

<p>“I’m proud of you, Claude. Now, what about the
papers?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got them, too.”</p>

<p>“Here?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” and Claude dived one hand into an inner
pocket and drew forth a package, at sight of which
Lamont’s eyes seemed to bulge from his head.</p>

<p>“There they are,” he resumed, throwing the packet
upon the table.</p>

<p>The millionaire snatched at it and opened the package.</p>

<p>He found the documents forged by George Richmond,
and opened the first one.</p>

<p>“Heavens! what have we escaped?” he ejaculated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
“It was a very narrow escape. Did you read these
papers, Claude?”</p>

<p>“No, never thought of that. I don’t care to know
what the old hag was.”</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar! these papers would have destroyed
us,” and Perry Lamont looked white. “She had it in
her power to break me up, and I don’t see why she
didn’t exercise it. Why, they’re worth a million almost.”</p>

<p>For some time Perry Lamont went over the papers
in silence and did not look up again till he had reached
the end of the last sheet.</p>

<p>Claude smiled inwardly all the time.</p>

<p>He knew that George had done his work well.</p>

<p>“Now, here they go,” said Lamont, senior, at last,
as he moved toward the grate where a fire burned.</p>

<p>Claude saw his father hold the documents over the
fire a few moments and then drop them into it.</p>

<p>As they caught fire the door opened and Opal
came in.</p>

<p>Her face was white and she was agitated.</p>

<p>Perry Lamont pointed in silence at the hearth and
looked toward his daughter.</p>

<p>Opal sprang to the fire and bent forward.</p>

<p>“Did you get it?” she asked, looking at her brother.</p>

<p>Claude said nothing.</p>

<p>“Did you have any trouble?”</p>

<p>“Some.”</p>

<p>“You paid him well for that service, didn’t you?”
she inquired of her father.</p>

<p>“We had an understanding.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. It saved us. We are no longer in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
the toils of the secret-keeper. Now no one can say
that Mother Flintstone was our near kin.”</p>

<p>The tall, regal-looking girl seemed almost beside
herself with joy.</p>

<p>She would have embraced Claude had not his coldness
repulsed her, and in a few moments she withdrew.</p>

<p>“I’ll take it now,” said Claude, addressing his
parent.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. You’ll place it to your account, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>Perry Lamont filled out a check for two hundred
thousand dollars, and pushed it across the desk to his
son.</p>

<p>Claude looked at it a moment, and then transferred
it to his pocket.</p>

<p>It was the cost of a secret; it was also blood money,
and the time was near at hand when that deed was to
return to plague the doers.</p>

<p>“Safe at last!” exclaimed Perry Lamont, when he
found himself alone. “It’s in the fire and he’s out of
the way. I would like to know if Claude really had
much trouble. The paper said it was vertigo, but we
know better. Claude is sure the post mortem will not
reveal anything. They won’t catch Claude!”</p>

<p>He chuckled to himself and looked at the darkened
ashes of the false confession in the grate.</p>

<p>By and by he returned to the desk and sat down,
his head falling on his breast like that of a weary
man, and in a short time he was fast asleep.</p>

<p>The house grew still. Outside Claude Lamont was
hurrying downtown, while Opal, in the parlor almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
for the first time since her bout with the detective,
thrummed the piano.</p>

<p>Some distance from the Lamont mansion Carter,
the detective, was watching the actions of a man who
mixed drinks behind a bar.</p>

<p>It was Caddy, the mixer at the Trocadero, and the
detective, well disguised, seemed to take more than
a passing interest in his movements.</p>

<p>By and by Caddy put on his coat and walked out,
with Carter at his heels.</p>

<p>All at once the hand of the detective fell upon
Caddy’s shoulder, and the little man stopped at once.</p>

<p>His face grew white when he looked up and saw
the keen eyes that seemed to read his inmost thoughts.</p>

<p>“Don’t do it again,” said the detective.</p>

<p>“What have I done?”</p>

<p>“Don’t threaten Miss Marne again.”</p>

<p>“But I—I—didn’t.”</p>

<p>“You did. Please don’t try it any more. That’s
all.”</p>

<p>Caddy did not catch his breath till Carter was out
of sight, and even then he seemed to breathe hard.</p>

<p>“Won’t I?” he hissed. “Just let me get another
chance at the girl, and I’ll make her think she isn’t
anybody in particular. She refused to play her part
of the game I’ve made up, but I’ll bring her around
in spite of the two men, that I will.”</p>

<p>But for all his braggadocio Caddy was ill at ease,
for instead of going on he retraced his steps to the
Trocadero, took a “bracer,” and remained indoors.</p>

<p>Nick Carter proceeded on his way, and at last pulled
up in front of Bristol Clara’s house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>The woman opened the door even before he knocked
and led him into the parlor.</p>

<p>“George Richmond is dead,” she exclaimed, a smile
coming to her lips. “Not quite dead, but I heard the
arrangements made. It’s a cool scheme, isn’t it? Who
are they going to beat out of two hundred thousand
dollars?”</p>

<p>“Perry Lamont, the millionaire,” was the answer.
“They’re all birds of the same feather, even the girl.
I had a narrow escape from her, but a miss is just as
good as a mile. She may know ere this that I don’t
lie dead in the parlor of the old mansion on Cedar
Street. I want a place at the peephole to-night,
Clara.”</p>

<p>“It’s at your service.”</p>

<p>“I won’t need it after to-night.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to close in on them?”</p>

<p>The detective nodded.</p>

<p>“Which one did it?” eagerly asked the girl.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Clara. I won’t make any mistake.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. You never do,” proudly answered
the tenant of the house.</p>

<p>Carter had set his time, but he could not prophesy
what the coming hours were to bring forth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />

<small>BETWEEN THE WALLS OF DOOM.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Shrewd as the detective was, he was destined to
meet one who was almost his equal in dexterity and
cunning before the hour set for closing in on his
quarry came around.</p>

<p>When he quitted Bristol Clara’s abode he proceeded
to his own quarters, where he desired, for the time,
to be alone.</p>

<p>The secrets of the trail he kept to himself.</p>

<p>If he knew the hand which struck Mother Flintstone
down he did not reveal it by word or deed, and, like
the experienced tracker, he was silent.</p>

<p>Several hours later the detective left the rooms and
reappeared on the street.</p>

<p>He was within a block of his place when a boy
approached him.</p>

<p>He extended a letter, which the detective at once
took.</p>

<p>“Who sent this, boy?” he asked, as he glanced at the
superscription.</p>

<p>“The leddy, sir.”</p>

<p>“But who was the lady?”</p>

<p>“Look inside. I guess that tells; ha, ha!” and the
messenger whisked around the nearest corner and disappeared.</p>

<p>Already the hands of Carter had broken the seal of
the missive thus strangely delivered, and in a moment
he had read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Could you spare me five minutes of your valuable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
time, Mr. Carter? I can make some dark places clear
to you. I can enlighten you about some important
things. Come secretly, for it is ticklish business. I
will be there. Come to Number — Hester Street.
Don’t knock! just open the door and come to the first
room on the left of the hall.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Sara P——</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>Nick Carter read the letter twice before he looked
up again.</p>

<p>He did not know Sara P——.</p>

<p>He had never heard of such a person, and he racked
his brain in vain to think who she might be.</p>

<p>He did not know what “dark places” she referred to.</p>

<p>She might mean some old trail which he had run
down, or she might have reference to Mother Flintstone’s
taking off.</p>

<p>The detective was puzzled.</p>

<p>However, he decided to see if there was anything
in the affair, to go to the designated number and meet
this woman-informer face to face.</p>

<p>As no time was set by the strange writer, he took
it for granted that she was to be found in the house
at any hour, and in a few minutes he was on his
way.</p>

<p>The detective was always ready to investigate anything
that promised to assist him on a trail.</p>

<p>More than once he had picked up some startling
clews from anonymous letters, and he thought that perhaps
“Sara P——” might know something of importance.</p>

<p>Hester Street is not the finest street in Gotham.
Neither is it a high-toned thoroughfare. There is a
mixture of poverty and wealth on Hester Street, but
society there in spots is not of the highest order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>Carter entered the street with some misgivings, but
not afraid.</p>

<p>He walked leisurely up the street, looking for the
number, and wondering what sort of looking woman
his correspondent was.</p>

<p>He found the house at last—a plain, two-story affair,
with shutters in front and signs of age about the
structure.</p>

<p>No one appeared at the door to greet him, but he
did not expect any one.</p>

<p>He walked up the steps and turned the knob.</p>

<p>The door opened easily, and he was in the hall.</p>

<p>“The first door to the left,” he mentally said, and
then he advanced toward it.</p>

<p>In another second he had pushed this portal open
and stood in a darkened room.</p>

<p>He saw no one.</p>

<p>Perhaps “Sara P——” was in another part of the
house and had not heard him enter.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, he was undeceived, and in a
flash he knew he had entered another trap.</p>

<p>The floor gave way beneath his feet, as if his weight
had suddenly broken it in.</p>

<p>The entire floor seemed to fall.</p>

<p>The detective made an effort to recover his equilibrium,
but the Fates were against him.</p>

<p>He fell down—down—and struck on his feet to
pitch forward in Stygian darkness.</p>

<p>At the same time a strange noise overhead told
him that the floor had resumed its original position,
and then for a few moments all was still.</p>

<p>The trapped detective had to smile to himself in
spite of his surroundings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>He could not help laughing at his situation, however
dark and hopeless it seemed to be; he had been
cleverly caught, and the bait had secured the prize.</p>

<p>It did not take him long to recover from the fall,
which had not injured him; only jarred him up a
little.</p>

<p>He went forward and found a wall ahead.</p>

<p>He followed the wall around, and came back to the
same spot, as he could tell by a little stone under his
feet.</p>

<p>The dungeon apparently had no outlet; it was like
a sealed-up prison of the olden time.</p>

<p>Carter put up his hands, but could not touch the
floor overhead.</p>

<p>Of course he could not tell how far he had fallen,
but he knew that the trap was directly above him.</p>

<p>Had “Sara P——” sprung the trap?</p>

<p>Had she lured him to this place to destroy him, and
thus get even for some of his detective work?</p>

<p>He did not doubt it.</p>

<p>Nick Carter, in the underground prison, said nothing
while he went around the walls.</p>

<p>He heard no noises in the house overhead, and no
one seemed to walk the floors there.</p>

<p>At last the detective struck a match on the stone
wall.</p>

<p>It revealed the dimensions of the dungeon, and he
surveyed it with eager curiosity. It was a dungeon
sure enough. He saw the stone walls and the manner
in which the stones were put together. There was
no escape.</p>

<p>Holding the little light above his head Carter saw
the underpinning of the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>He also found the strong iron hinges upon which
the great trap had worked at crime’s bidding.</p>

<p>He was like a trapped fox.</p>

<p>Hemmed in by walls of stone, with an impregnable
ceiling overhead, where could there be an avenue of
escape?</p>

<p>All at once, at the last flashing of the lucifer, the
detective saw some words on the wall.</p>

<p>It reminded him of the words on the wall of the
room where Jack, his spy, had been strangled.</p>

<p>Had the same hand written them there?</p>

<p>He threw the match to the ground, struck another
and sprang eagerly forward.</p>

<p>He held the little light against the wall and read
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am doomed to perish here. There is no escape
from this hole of death. I was decoyed here like a
rabbit, and I die for my folly. Let the next unfortunate
person know that I, Lewis Newell, was the victim
of Opal Lamont’s cunning. The woman is a
tigress. Farewell.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Lewis Newell.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>For a full half minute the detective seemed to hold
his breath.</p>

<p>He read the writing again and again, and at last
threw the stump of the match at his feet.</p>

<p>Doomed to die!</p>

<p>Another had been before him, and that person
ascribed his end to Opal Lamont.</p>

<p>Was this accusation true?</p>

<p>The old detective recalled his adventure in the house
on Cedar Street and how narrowly he had escaped
death at the hands of this same girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>Perhaps this house belonged to the millionaire, like
that one.</p>

<p>Once more in darkness, Carter had time to study
the situation.</p>

<p>His curiosity got the better of him, and again he
looked at the writing on the wall.</p>

<p>It looked plainer than ever now.</p>

<p>Who was Lewis Newell, the former victim?</p>

<p>He had never heard of such a person, but he did
not doubt the truth of the inscription.</p>

<p>Suddenly the detective heard a sound that seemed
to come from above.</p>

<p>As he turned his face upward the floor seemed to
lift, and his eyes were blinded by an intense glare.</p>

<p>It was as if an electric globe had suddenly been
uncovered in his face, and the light was so strong that
he fell back, blinking his eyes like an owl.</p>

<p>The glare vanished as suddenly as it came into
being, but when he looked again he caught sight of a
little ball burning in one corner of the trap.</p>

<p>It sent out a singular odor, not unpleasant, but
enervating, and the detective’s system seemed to yield
to its influence from the first.</p>

<p>“The accursed thing is the death agent which may
have killed Newell!” he cried, as he sprang forward
and set his foot on the burning ball.</p>

<p>At that moment an explosion occurred, the interior
of the dungeon seemed to collapse and Carter became
unconscious.</p>

<p>Perhaps the end had come.</p>

<p>When the detective came out of the darkness of
doom, as it were, he was lying on his face.</p>

<p>In a moment he staggered up and put out his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>They touched a wall as hard and cold as the one
they had touched last.</p>

<p>Where was he and in what sort of trap?</p>

<p>Slowly the adventures of the last few hours came
back to his excited brain.</p>

<p>He recalled the note, the visit to the house on Hester
Street, the fall through the trapdoor and the burning
ball.</p>

<p>These thoughts came fast and thick; they seemed to
contend for supremacy in his brain and he breathed
hard.</p>

<p>“I must get out,” was his cry. “Woman or tigress,
she shall not keep me in this vile place!”</p>

<p>But getting out was the puzzle.</p>

<p>He circumnavigated his prison like a captive in the
dungeons of Venice.</p>

<p>He sounded every foot of space, stood on his tiptoes
in a vain effort to reach the ceiling, felt the walls
again and again and at last gave up.</p>

<p>For once at least the famous detective seemed at
the end of life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXV.<br />

<small>A COMPLETE KNOCK-OUT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, Margie Marne was having an adventure
of her own, to which we will now recur.</p>

<p>In another part of the city, and about the same hour
that witnessed the strange explosion in the dungeon
where Carter was confined, the girl sat in her little
room.</p>

<p>She was quite alone, but all the time she was watched
by a pair of eyes that did not lose sight of her.</p>

<p>These eyes glittered in the head of a man on the floor
above, and he was enabled to watch the girl through
a hole deftly cut in the floor.</p>

<p>All unconscious of the espionage, the girl looked
over a few papers which she had taken from their
hiding place in one corner of the room, where they
would baffle the lynx eyes of a keen man, and now and
then a smile came to her face.</p>

<p>All at once she heard footsteps approach her door,
and for the first time in an hour she looked up.</p>

<p>A rap sounded, but Margie hesitated.</p>

<p>Should she open the door and admit her visitor?</p>

<p>Perhaps it was Carter, whom she wanted to see just
then, but a sudden fear took possession of her.</p>

<p>At last, however, Margie arose, and hiding the papers
in her bosom, crossed the room.</p>

<p>Her hand was on the latch, but for all this she still
hesitated.</p>

<p>In another moment, as if beating down her last suspicion,
Margie opened the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>A man stood before her. It was not the person who
had offered to protect her from Caddy’s advances, nor
was it Caddy himself.</p>

<p>As she held the door open the stranger advanced
into the apartment and turned suddenly upon Margie.</p>

<p>Her breath went fast, and she gazed at the man
with half-stifled feelings.</p>

<p>“Miss Marne?” he asked in a peculiar voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Alone, I see.”</p>

<p>“I am quite alone, but I cannot imagine to whom I
owe the present call.”</p>

<p>“Sit down, girl.”</p>

<p>There was something commanding in the tones,
which had suddenly changed, but Margie did not stir.</p>

<p>“I want to talk with you,” continued the man. “And
I prefer to have you seated.”</p>

<p>Margie glanced at the door and then toward the
window, the eyes of her caller following her, and for
half a second her heart seemed in her throat.</p>

<p>“I want those papers,” and the fellow, whose face
was covered with a heavy brown beard, held out his
hand.</p>

<p>“What papers?” demanded the girl.</p>

<p>“The ones you have just been looking over.”</p>

<p>No wonder Margie started.</p>

<p>“Come, don’t mince matters with me. I won’t have
it. Are they in your bosom, girl?”</p>

<p>Margie fell back, but the man advanced.</p>

<p>“I am here for them,” he went on. “You can’t cheat
me out of them. Come, hand them over.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“Not a word unless you intend to comply with my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
demand! You know where the papers are. You got
them in Mother Flintstone’s den.”</p>

<p>“My God——”</p>

<p>“I hit the nail on the head, did I?” brutally laughed
the man. “I thought my arrow wouldn’t go far wide
of the mark. Here, I’ll despoil you of the papers by
force if you don’t tamely submit.”</p>

<p>Margie was nearly against the wall now, and she
looked at the man like a startled fawn.</p>

<p>She now felt, yes, knew that the beard was but a
mask, and she asked herself whom she faced.</p>

<p>Claude Lamont or George Richmond?</p>

<p>She could retreat no farther, and remembering her
adventure in the house which had succumbed to the
fire fiend, she nearly fainted.</p>

<p>Already the powerful hands of the unknown almost
touched her bosom; she could feel his hot, wine-laden
breath on her cheek and she expected any minute
to be hurled across the room and robbed.</p>

<p>She made one last effort, but the movement was intercepted,
and she stood in his grasp!</p>

<p>He held her at arms’ length and glared at her after
the manner of a wild beast.</p>

<p>The poor girl was a child in the iron grip of the
man, and all at once he drew her toward him and began
to look for the documents.</p>

<p>“Don’t! For Heaven’s sake, have some respect for
my sex!” gasped Margie. “You can have them.”</p>

<p>“I can, eh? Well, hand them over.”</p>

<p>Margie, with trembling fingers, did so, and at sight
of the papers he uttered a gleeful cry.</p>

<p>The next moment he released her, and she sank into
the nearest chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>She saw him step back a pace and open the papers,
over which he eagerly ran his eye.</p>

<p>“Is this all you had, girl?” he suddenly demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!”</p>

<p>Margie’s face colored.</p>

<p>“I want the others.”</p>

<p>“I have no others.”</p>

<p>“These are but letters from a lover. Where are the
papers that once belonged to the old hag?”</p>

<p>“That is not for me to tell.”</p>

<p>“You defy me, eh?”</p>

<p>“I defy no one.”</p>

<p>“I’ll choke you to death but what I get the truth.
I’ll have the right papers or your life!”</p>

<p>“You must take my life, then.”</p>

<p>The girl had strangely recovered her self-possession.</p>

<p>She could look at him now without flinching, and
the terrible hand dreaded a few moments before had
no terrors for her now.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man threw the letters upon the table
and looked fiercely at the girl.</p>

<p>She withstood his look like a heroine.</p>

<p>“Be quick about it!” he cried.</p>

<p>“I have no other papers,” calmly said Margie.</p>

<p>He laughed derisively and then glanced toward the
door.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix you,” he exclaimed. “You’ve been in our
road long enough, and the only sure way to get rid
of you is to leave you here a fit subject for the
morgue.”</p>

<p>The moment he came toward her Margie sprang up.</p>

<p>She was strong again, and suddenly catching up a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
poker which stood near the chair, she placed herself
in an attitude of defiance.</p>

<p>“You advance at your peril,” she said, in determined
tones. “I shall defend myself to the last extremity.”</p>

<p>“Against me? Why, girl, you don’t know what you
are saying.”</p>

<p>“You shall find out if you advance, I say.”</p>

<p>He laughed again, and came forward.</p>

<p>In an instant the heavy rod was lifted above the
girl’s head, and the next second she brought it down
with all her might.</p>

<p>It was a blow such as a giantess might have delivered,
for the man’s lifted arms went down, and
he received the full weight of the poker upon his head.</p>

<p>He gave one gasp and sank to the floor like one
killed outright, and Margie, with the novel weapon
still clutched in her hands, looked at him, while a
deathly pallor overspread her face.</p>

<p>Had she killed him?</p>

<p>For a short time she stood there, barely realizing
that the whole thing was not a dream, and then she
bent over the man.</p>

<p>As she touched the beard it came off and fell to the
floor beside the face.</p>

<p>Margie uttered a scream.</p>

<p>She had seen that face before—seen it in company
with Claude Lamont, and she knew that the man was
his associate in evil and one of the chief men in the
plot against Mother Flintstone and herself.</p>

<p>She sprang up suddenly and ran from the room,
shutting the door behind her.</p>

<p>Down on the street she saw no one, though she
looked everywhere for a policeman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>Moments were flitting away, and she suddenly
thought of Carter.</p>

<p>She knew where he lodged, and she would tell him
of her adventure.</p>

<p>In a moment she was on her way, but she was
doomed to disappointment; the detective’s door was
locked and she could not elicit a response.</p>

<p>Baffled, Margie turned back again.</p>

<p>She had taken up nearly twenty minutes on the
streets, and when she reached the vicinity of her humble
home she thought of the man left on the floor.</p>

<p>She glided upstairs cautiously, just as if the dead
could hear her, but at the door she stopped and
listened.</p>

<p>All was still beyond it.</p>

<p>Margie put on a bold front, and opened the portal.</p>

<p>The first look seemed to root her to the spot.</p>

<p>The room was untenanted.</p>

<p>No one lay on the floor, and the little place, with this
exception, seemed just as she left it.</p>

<p>The man, her victim, was gone.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven! his blood is not on my hands, rascal
though he was!” exclaimed Margie Marne, as she
leaped across the threshold and shut the door behind
her.</p>

<p>If she had returned a little sooner she might have
caught sight of her would-be robber.</p>

<p>She might have seen a man come out of the house,
with his hat drawn over his brows and the brown
beard awry.</p>

<p>This individual hurried away, nor looked he back, as
if he thought he was not safe from molestation, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
his gait told how eager he was to get out of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he turned up in a certain house
in another part of the city, and dropped into a chair
as the tenant of the room demanded to know if he had
been in a prize fight.</p>

<p>“Not quite, but I struck an Amazon,” was the reply,
and he of the brown beard tried to smile.</p>

<p>“Tell me; did you encounter Margie?”</p>

<p>“No one else. What made you guess her?”</p>

<p>“Her name popped into my head somehow or other.
Guess I must have been thinking of her when you
came in. What did she hit you with?”</p>

<p>“With a crowbar, from the way my head feels; but
never mind. It’s a long lane, you know.”</p>

<p>Claude Lamont smiled.</p>

<p>“You do pretty well for a ‘dead man,’” and then
both men burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>“I’ll wring her neck for it yet!” suddenly cried
George Richmond. “I’ll have the blood of that girl
for her blow!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />

<small>THE PARRICIDE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“You’d better not try it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” snarled Richmond.</p>

<p>“She may be dangerous.”</p>

<p>“That chit? Pshaw!”</p>

<p>“Just try it. See here. You don’t want to be too
gay just now. Don’t you know you’re a dead man?”</p>

<p>“So I am.”</p>

<p>“Well, be a little careful. What if Carter gets on
to our game?”</p>

<p>“Carter mustn’t do that.”</p>

<p>“Of course not, but we must see that he cannot.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes longer the two men, watched by Bristol
Clara, the tenant in the next house, remained in the
room, and then Richmond bade Claude good night.</p>

<p>The moment the millionaire’s son found himself
alone he struck the table with his fist.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t I really kill that man?” he exclaimed.
“He is bound to be my evil genius, after all. I can’t
see my way clear to ultimate success with him in the
way. He’ll blackmail me, and what can I do? If he
were really dead——”</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence, but broke it off suddenly,
and arose, throwing his cigar away.</p>

<p>“I’ll go home,” he said.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he was met at the door of his
home by his sister Opal, whose face told him that she
had something of importance to say.</p>

<p>“Father is gone,” said the girl, with a gasp, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
would have fallen if Claude had not caught her around
the waist.</p>

<p>“Gone?” echoed the young sport.</p>

<p>“It is true. You can see for yourself.”</p>

<p>Opal led the way to the library, and mutely pointed
at her father’s chair.</p>

<p>“When did you miss him?” asked Claude.</p>

<p>“An hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Did he leave any message behind?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>Opal handed her brother a crumpled note, and the
young man leaned toward the light to read its contents.</p>

<p>“My God! you don’t believe that?” he exclaimed,
turning upon his sister.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to believe,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“What have you done?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I’ve been waiting for you. I sent to the
club, but the message came back that you had not been
there.”</p>

<p>“Something must be done. Certainly father did
not mean this. He has not gone to the police.”</p>

<p>“I—don’t—know.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see. He may have gone to the river in a fit of
madness. He would not tell all he knows about Mother
Flintstone.”</p>

<p>“I should think he would not.”</p>

<p>Claude seized his hat and rushed from the house.</p>

<p>For a little while his brain seemed to swim, and the
lights blinded him.</p>

<p>He did not ask what Opal would do now that she
was again the sole occupant of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>He did not seem to care.</p>

<p>Perry Lamont was a runaway, with a great secret
at his tongue’s end and millions at stake.</p>

<p>For some time the old nabob had been subject to
strange spells of mania, and the worst was to be
feared.</p>

<p>It was this that urged Claude Lamont on and on.</p>

<p>He could not wait till he got downtown, and minutes
seemed hours to him.</p>

<p>He thought of a thousand things.</p>

<p>He wondered what had become of Carter, and more
than once he looked back, as if he expected to see
Nick on his trail.</p>

<p>At a fashionable saloon he stopped long enough to
gulp down something for his nerves, and then he
hastened on again.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped, and then dropped into the
shadow of a large building.</p>

<p>A man was crossing the street—coming toward him.</p>

<p>His heart took a great leap into his throat, for it
was the very man he was hunting for—his father.</p>

<p>Claude stood in the shadows and watched him like
a hawk.</p>

<p>He could not take his eyes off the old man, and as
he neared him he debated in his mind what to do.</p>

<p>As the millionaire stepped upon the sidewalk within
a few feet of him the son darted forward and clutched
him by the arm.</p>

<p>“Father!” he cried.</p>

<p>With a powerful effort Perry Lamont shook the grip
loose and looked into Claude’s face.</p>

<p>“My God! he’s mad!” ejaculated the young man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>“It is Claude. Don’t you know me?” pleaded the
son.</p>

<p>“Let me go. I’ve been looking after my sister—little
Sis, you know.”</p>

<p>“Heavens! he means Mother Flintstone!” thought
Claude.</p>

<p>“I can’t find her. What’s become of Sis?”</p>

<p>“I’ll find her for you.”</p>

<p>“What; you’ll show me where she is?” cried the
old man.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. Come with me.”</p>

<p>In an instant Lamont’s mind changed, and he became
as docile as a lamb.</p>

<p>As Claude was near the house he occupied when
not at home he guided his father thither and let him
inside.</p>

<p>Conducting him to the library, where he had just
had an interview with George Richmond, he seated
his parent and took a chair himself.</p>

<p>“Is she here?” asked Lamont.</p>

<p>“Yes; you’ll see her presently.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t wait. I want to see Sis now. I haven’t
seen her for years, and I want to tell her about the
money I have kept for her so long.”</p>

<p>“What money?”</p>

<p>“I’ve kept it for Sis. It belongs to her—the thousands
which were left to her, you know.”</p>

<p>“What if Sis isn’t in need of money?” queried
Claude.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll throw it into the fire! No one shall have
it but her. I will see to that. Who are you?”</p>

<p>Claude smiled grimly.</p>

<p>His father had not recognized him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>“Come, you don’t want Sis to have the money,” he
cried, and before the son could prevent, the other was
on his feet, his eyes glaring like the orbs of a wolf.</p>

<p>“I’ll have your blood if you don’t tell me!” shrieked
the mad millionaire.</p>

<p>“I’m your son.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not! My son? It’s a lie!”</p>

<p>Claude saw his danger, and the madman advancing
upon him made him throw out his hand in self-defense.</p>

<p>“My son is at home!” cried Lamont, senior. “You
are not he. I won’t believe it!”</p>

<p>“But, father——”</p>

<p>The sentence was not finished, for all at once Perry
Lamont sprang at his son, and grabbing him by the
shoulders, threw him against the wall.</p>

<p>There was a startled cry on the other side of it
from the woman whose eyes seemed glued to the
paper there.</p>

<p>“I’ll kill you like a dog if you don’t tell me where
Sis is. I went to her den—they called her Mother
Flintstone, you know—but she wasn’t there. Where
is she?”</p>

<p>“Let me loose first.”</p>

<p>“And let you run off? Not much; ha! ha!” and
the maniac laughed. “I won’t do anything of the
kind.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t show you where Sis is unless you do
that. I won’t run away, father.”</p>

<p>“It is false. You can’t fool me. I will hold you
here till you tell the truth.”</p>

<p>“Well, Sis, is asleep in the room yonder.”</p>

<p>“Is that true?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>Claude Lamont wanted to gain time. If he could
get rid of his father’s maddened hands he might effect
his escape, for just now he was in danger.</p>

<p>Perry Lamont glanced toward the door, and seemed
disposed to believe his desperate son.</p>

<p>But suddenly he appeared to change his mind, for
again his eyes shot forth sparks of fire.</p>

<p>“Call her out here,” he said.</p>

<p>Claude’s heart seemed to sink within him.</p>

<p>He knew he could not call back the dead.</p>

<p>He wished for the door to open and admit some
one; he would have rejoiced then, with his father’s
fingers buried in his throat, to have seen Carter.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you one second, or to hades you go!” suddenly
cried Perry Lamont.</p>

<p>Claude’s blood seemed to run cold.</p>

<p>One second to live!</p>

<p>What had become of George Richmond?</p>

<p>Why didn’t that worthy turn up to save him in the
nick of time?</p>

<p>Why had he guided his father to that house and not
home, where he would have had Opal for an ally?</p>

<p>Fate was against him.</p>

<p>“Quick! quick!” exclaimed the madman. “Tell me
where Sis is or I will tear your throat here!”</p>

<p>Claude made one last effort.</p>

<p>He summoned all his strength and dashed forward.</p>

<p>His father’s feet tripped on the carpet, and, falling,
he dragged him down.</p>

<p>Father and son fell in a heap on the carpet, and for
half a second seemed stunned by the tumble.</p>

<p>Claude was the first to recover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>He raised himself and tore himself loose from the
maniacal fingers.</p>

<p>As he did so his father sprang up with the roar of
a baffled tiger, and launched himself forward.</p>

<p>It left Claude little time for reflection or action.</p>

<p>He saw danger ahead, and his hands were bare of
any weapon.</p>

<p>But suddenly he snatched up a glass paper weight
from the desk, and launched it straight at his father’s
face.</p>

<p>An arrow never went straighter to the mark than
did the paper weight. It struck the millionaire fairly
in the face, and he went down like a stricken ox.</p>

<p>On the carpet he gave a convulsive gasp and moved
one arm; that was all.</p>

<p>“He invited it,” said Claude. “He forced it upon
himself. They can’t blame me for this thing.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later he stood on the street, with the
house darkened behind him and the glim of the lamps
in his eyes.</p>

<p>He looked like Cain; the brand was on his brow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVII.<br />

<small>CARTER’S ESCAPE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>We left Carter in durance in the dungeon where
the strange explosion had taken place.</p>

<p>Truly the detective was in the direst straits, and he
could not forget the writing on the wall.</p>

<p>He did not know who “Lewis Newell” was, and
he did not stop to inquire.</p>

<p>The sentence said that Opal Lamont, the fair daughter
of the millionaire, was responsible for the prisoner’s
fate, and this set the detective to thinking.</p>

<p>Perhaps the house to which he had been decoyed
belonged to Perry Lamont, like another house he
knew of.</p>

<p>He recalled his visit to the nabob’s mansion, where
he had confronted Opal, and he recalled as well her
demeanor.</p>

<p>That she had revengeful blood he well knew.</p>

<p>Her beauty was tigerish.</p>

<p>But first of all the detective wanted to get out of
the dark place, and he resolved that it should not hold
him long.</p>

<p>How to get out was the question, but for all this he
set about it with all his wits at work.</p>

<p>The singular odors arising from the bomb had not
overcome him longer than a few minutes, and now
the dungeon seemed fairly free of them.</p>

<p>Once more he went around the walls and sounded
them again. He stooped where he had seen the flash
of light as the bomb burst, and found that the wall had
yielded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>A stone was loosened, and this gave him hope.</p>

<p>Beyond the wall must lie liberty.</p>

<p>With an energy born of despair Carter toiled until
he had made a hole underneath the wall large enough
to admit his body, and he did not hesitate to squeeze
through it.</p>

<p>Beyond the wall sure enough lay freedom, for he
felt the cool night air on his cheeks and found himself
in a cramped back yard.</p>

<p>Out of durance at last, Carter breathed a prayer of
thankfulness and filled up the hole.</p>

<p>He stood for some little time in the yard, and then
cleared the fence which stood between him and the
street.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he might have been seen to enter
Bristol Clara’s house.</p>

<p>The woman uttered a cry as she saw him, and pulled
him forward.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” she cried; “but why didn’t you
come sooner?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t. Circumstances prevented,” said the detective,
with a grim smile, which Bristol Clara did not
understand.</p>

<p>“What’s happened, girl?”</p>

<p>“Murder!”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“There!”</p>

<p>The woman pointed across the room toward the next
house and looked at Carter.</p>

<p>“Who committed it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Claude Lamont.”</p>

<p>“Then they’re even,” was the detective’s answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>Clara did not reply, but led the detective to the
peephole, and bade him look.</p>

<p>The room beyond the partition was dimly lighted,
but he could see its appointments and single tenant.</p>

<p>A man was stretched on the floor, silent and still.</p>

<p>“That’s the victim,” said the woman at his side.</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Perry Lamont.”</p>

<p>“And you say Claude did it? His son?”</p>

<p>“His son. I saw the whole affair.”</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it, Clara.”</p>

<p>Bristol Clara did so, and the detective listened without
once interrupting the woman.</p>

<p>“I must see the man yonder,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“That’s easy. The house is tenanted only by the
dead. You can easily get inside.”</p>

<p>It did not take Carter long to reach the room where
Perry Lamont lay.</p>

<p>He raised the man’s head and saw the dark spot
made by the murderous paper weight; then he lowered
it again to the floor.</p>

<p>He searched the room thoroughly, and found more
than one thing which told him that it had been one of
Claude Lamont’s nests.</p>

<p>At last he rejoined Clara in the other house.</p>

<p>“Now for the round-up,” said he.</p>

<p>The woman looked at him, but did not speak.</p>

<p>“You once asked me who killed Mother Flintstone,”
said Nick.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“Of course you do. You find out all these things.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
I never doubted that you would reach the end of this
trail.”</p>

<p>“Well, woman, I can tell you now.”</p>

<p>Bristol Clara leaned forward, and Carter whispered
a word into her ear.</p>

<p>“My God! you don’t mean that?” cried the woman,
as she recoiled, with very little color in her face.</p>

<p>“Every word of it.”</p>

<p>“It cannot be.”</p>

<p>“It is true.”</p>

<p>“Then go and do your duty;” said she. “Don’t
let the guilty escape, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to. I’ll see you later, Clara. Only
keep a watch over the man in yonder. The murderer
may come back. Perhaps it was self-defense, but he
isn’t remorseful. It is murder all the same.”</p>

<p>The detective made his way from the house and
to another part of the city. He had found in the desk
a bit of paper, with a scrawled address thereon.</p>

<p>It was a certain number in Brooklyn, and inside the
hour the detective was across the river.</p>

<p>It did not take him very long to reach the house,
which he found darkened and silent, but his ring
brought footsteps downstairs and to the door.</p>

<p>As the portal opened Carter caught sight of an old
man’s face, and he addressed him.</p>

<p>“I desire to see Mr. Holden, your roomer.”</p>

<p>“He’s sound asleep, sir.”</p>

<p>“I must see him all the same. Which room does
he occupy?”</p>

<p>The detective pushed forward, with one hand on
the old man’s arm, and the old fellow seemed to suspect
the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>“Don’t disturb my wife. She’s sick upstairs. You
shall see Mr. Holden. I hope he isn’t a fugitive from
justice, sir?”</p>

<p>There was no answer by the detective, for the old
man opened a door and motioned Nick across another
threshold.</p>

<p>As Carter entered the room a human figure sprang
from a bed and stood on the carpet before him.</p>

<p>“How are you?” said the detective.</p>

<p>The reply he got was a snort like a sound from a
restive tiger, and George Richmond, brought to bay,
threw a swift glance toward the door.</p>

<p>“What’s wanting?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I want you.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“For conspiracy.”</p>

<p>The man before Carter seemed to catch his breath.</p>

<p>It was not so bad after all.</p>

<p>In fact, a grim smile appeared at the corners of his
mouth and his look softened.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he next asked.</p>

<p>“Come, you know me, George,” said the detective.
“I’m not disguised.”</p>

<p>“Well, here I am.”</p>

<p>The half-dressed man stepped forward, but the moment
Carter advanced a step he picked up a chair and
with the fury of a maniac threw it above his head.</p>

<p>The old landlord behind the detective uttered a terrified
cry and retreated, and as he held the only light
there was, the room was wrapped in darkness.</p>

<p>Carter struck a match, and at the same time thrust
forward his revolver.</p>

<p>But the match revealed nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>George Richmond was gone!</p>

<p>For half a minute Carter stood like a person in a
dream, but a sudden cry from the old man aroused
him.</p>

<p>“He’s crept under the bed, sir,” was the cry.</p>

<p>With a light laugh Carter sprang forward and
caught hold of the foot he found.</p>

<p>The next moment a bullet whizzed past his head
and then he dragged the rascal forth.</p>

<p>Lying on the floor, handcuffed, George Richmond
looked up into Carter’s face and grinned.</p>

<p>“For conspiracy, eh?” he said. “That’s news to
me.”</p>

<p>“It’s better for that than murder,” was the answer,
and then Carter took his prisoner away.</p>

<p>“Now for the other birds,” said the detective, as he
turned from the station house.</p>

<p>He proceeded uptown and, late as it was, rang the
bell of the Lamont mansion.</p>

<p>For some time no one answered him, and then he
heard footsteps inside.</p>

<p>“It’s Opal herself,” thought Carter, as he waited
for the door to open.</p>

<p>Yes, it was the handsome daughter of the dead
millionaire, and she maintained her composure as she
looked into the detective’s face.</p>

<p>“It’s a late call, miss,” said Carter, as he stepped
inside. “But it is a case of necessity. I’ve found your
father.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?”</p>

<p>How terribly cool this girl was.</p>

<p>“Yes; he’s been found and will be home shortly.”</p>

<p>“That’s clever of you. I did not know you were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
looking for him. He went off a little unexpectedly,
you see——”</p>

<p>“I understand. He is dead——”</p>

<p>“Father dead?”</p>

<p>It was a real start now, but in a moment Opal regained
her composure.</p>

<p>“Miss Lamont, did you ever know a man named
Lewis Newell?”</p>

<p>She fell back and seemed to gasp for breath.</p>

<p>“Lewis Newell?” she echoed, trying to become calm
again. “I don’t know that I ever knew such a man.”</p>

<p>“You did not decoy him to a dungeon? You did
not coolly let him perish there? I’ve read his last
words on the wall, miss. I know that that is not your
only crime!”</p>

<p>“It is false!”</p>

<p>She looked defiant and her eyes flashed.</p>

<p>“There’s another, miss,” continued Carter.</p>

<p>“You dare not say that again.”</p>

<p>“I say it again. There’s another crime. It is the
greatest one of all.”</p>

<p>“What is it, pray?”</p>

<p>“The murder of Mother Flintstone!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br />

<small>JUSTICE’S ROUND-UP.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Opal Lamont seemed to grow into a statue before
the detective.</p>

<p>She did not move a muscle, but her face grew white,
and the detective thought she would sink to the floor.</p>

<p>But suddenly she started up and calmly invited
Carter into the parlor.</p>

<p>The detective accepted and watched her like a hawk,
for had not she once faced him with a revolver, and
was not this the woman named by “Lewis Newell” on
the wall of the dungeon?</p>

<p>Opal Lamont seemed calm now.</p>

<p>She faced the man of many trails and even smiled.</p>

<p>“The murder of Mother Flintstone?” she said, recalling
the detective’s words in the hall. “You accuse
me of that, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Let me see your proofs, please.”</p>

<p>Carter dived one hand into his bosom and drew
forth a little packet, upon which the eyes of Opal
Lamont were riveted from the first.</p>

<p>He had never shown this to any one.</p>

<p>No one knew that he found it in an obscure corner
of Mother Flintstone’s den the night he went thither
with Mulberry Billy, the street waif, and the old
woman’s “chum.”</p>

<p>Opal leaned forward and watched the hands of the
detective open the packet.</p>

<p>She never took her eyes from the “find,” and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
the last bit of covering had been taken off she appeared
to grow white.</p>

<p>One-half of a ring lay in Carter’s hand, and he
glanced from it to the immobile face of the millionaire’s
daughter.</p>

<p>“You found that in the house, I suppose?” asked
Opal.</p>

<p>“Yes; in the darkest corner, not far from the spot
where you struck the blow.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?”</p>

<p>“Not quite.”</p>

<p>“You need not go on. Look at me, Mr. Carter.
It was for the honor of this house. She was wicked.”</p>

<p>“She was your father’s sister!”</p>

<p>“She made a bad match. She was disowned, or,
rather, she disinherited herself.”</p>

<p>“But that was no excuse for the crime.”</p>

<p>“She might have paraded the relationship before
the world,” cried Opal. “She was positively dangerous.
She was a perpetual menace. It was dreadful.”</p>

<p>“You took it upon yourself to put her out of the
way. You went to the house——”</p>

<p>“To silence her tongue!” broke in Opal Lamont.
“Murder was not in my mind at first. But she taunted
me; she laughed at me when I offered to make her
rich. She even threatened to appear in public and
boast of the kinship. That was more than I could
stand.”</p>

<p>“You struck her then?”</p>

<p>“I did. I broke the ring with the blow. I did not
miss it till I came home. The other half strangely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
clung to my finger till I reached this house. I thought
I had lost the rest on the street.”</p>

<p>“You nearly involved others in that crime.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Your brother was for a time suspected of the
murder, and then his chum, George Richmond.”</p>

<p>“Did it deceive you?”</p>

<p>“For a time. I traced out the ownership of the
ring. I did it with the utmost secrecy. But a short
time ago I half believed that one of them was the
guilty person, but I am undeceived now.”</p>

<p>A haughty smile came to the girl’s lips.</p>

<p>She made an impatient gesture and then said:</p>

<p>“Let us dismiss these things. We can come back
to them, you know. You said a while ago that father
was dead.”</p>

<p>“He is.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“In one of the many houses he owned.”</p>

<p>“I thought he would take his life in his madness.
He would have given his wealth for the keeping of
the secret of the kinship. How did he do it?”</p>

<p>For a moment Carter was silent.</p>

<p>“It was not suicide,” said he, looking at Opal. “It
was the greater crime—murder!”</p>

<p>She started like one electrified.</p>

<p>“Another murder? I want to see him avenged,
even if I have hands that are red! I want you to take
the trail of his slayer. You will do this, Mr. Carter?
You won’t refuse to become the servant of your human
quarry?”</p>

<p>“It is no mystery,” was the reply. “The murder of
your father is not a puzzle!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>“Then you know——”</p>

<p>“I know, for I have a living witness.”</p>

<p>Opal was silent; but her deep eyes seemed to pierce
the detective through and through.</p>

<p>“I’m calm now. Name him.”</p>

<p>At this moment the front door opened and some one
came in.</p>

<p>“It is Claude, my brother,” said the girl, scarcely
above a whisper. “Wait a minute. He may go upstairs.”</p>

<p>Carter looked toward the door and seemed to smile.</p>

<p>“Call him in here. His coming will answer the
question you have just put.”</p>

<p>Opal sprang across the carpet and opened the door,
revealing the figure of Claude in the main hall.</p>

<p>“This way, Claude,” said she. “A gentleman wants
to see you.”</p>

<p>It was a lightning glance that passed from the hallway
to the man in the parlor.</p>

<p>Claude Lamont knew the detective at once.</p>

<p>He hesitated, but Opal clutched his sleeve and pulled
him forward by main force.</p>

<p>“You know this man. It is the trailer,” she said.</p>

<p>A dark scowl came to the young man’s face.</p>

<p>“I know him!” he almost hissed.</p>

<p>The next instant the daughter turned again to Carter
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Now, go on. You said you knew who killed father.
Name the murderer.”</p>

<p>The hand of the detective was raised as his figure
straightened, and in a second it covered the young man
before him.</p>

<p>“There’s the man!” was all he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>Though he spoke in low tones the words seemed to
ring throughout the handsome parlor.</p>

<p>Claude Lamont grew white and Opal fell back.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, she started forward and paused
in front of her speechless brother.</p>

<p>“Is it true?” she cried.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>“You must speak! You must tell the truth. My
hands are red and yours seem to be! You have heard
this merciless trailer. He says you are a parricide!
Is it true? Before Heaven, answer me, Claude Lamont!”</p>

<p>The lips of the young sport moved, but no words
issued forth.</p>

<p>He seemed to have been struck with palsy.</p>

<p>“You heard me, murderer!” cried Opal, flinging herself
upon her brother. “You must not stand there like
a log and say nothing. You shall tell the truth. You
did it.”</p>

<p>Claude flung her off and she nearly toppled against
the mahogany table.</p>

<p>“I did it, and under the circumstances I would do
it again!” he exclaimed. “He was coming at me like
a wild beast, and I had to fight or perish.”</p>

<p>“Swear this!” cried the girl.</p>

<p>Claude raised one hand above his head.</p>

<p>“Where did you find him?”</p>

<p>“On the street.”</p>

<p>“But you did not bring him home?”</p>

<p>“I did not. I took him to one of our houses——”</p>

<p>“And killed him there? Murderer!”</p>

<p>That instant, with the fury of a madman, Claude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
turned upon his sister and covered her white face with
his quivering hand.</p>

<p>“Murderer, eh? What are you? Don’t you know
that the curse of blood has been upon this house for
years? The curse of blood and money! Nearly a
century ago one of your ancestors murdered his bride,
and ever since the stain has been upon the house. It
has skipped a few generations, but it is with us now.
Richmond and I have kept your red secret. We know
who killed Mother Flintstone. Does the detective
know?”</p>

<p>“He knows,” calmly answered Opal.</p>

<p>“And does he know that the girl called Margie
Marne is the grandchild of Mother Flintstone?”</p>

<p>Nick nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s all.”</p>

<p>Claude Lamont turned and stalked coolly from the
room.</p>

<p>At the door he stopped and looked back.</p>

<p>“I’ll be on hand when wanted,” he said. “It was
self-defense. I had to take the old man’s life.”</p>

<p>Carter and Opal heard him on the stairs, and in a
few moments they heard a door shut overhead.</p>

<p>Long before morning a policeman stood guard over
the dead millionaire’s mansion.</p>

<p>The night passed slowly.</p>

<p>New York was getting ready to awake to the solution
of another murder mystery and another crime.</p>

<p>The detective was making the last move in the office
of the chief of police, who had listened to the story
of his last trail.</p>

<p>George Richmond lay in the station-house cell fast
asleep, just as if he had never been concerned in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
plot to rob Perry Lamont, the millionaire, with the
aid of his scapegrace son.</p>

<p>The morning broke.</p>

<p>Carter went to the Lamont mansion.</p>

<p>Upon parting the night before Opal had pledged
her honor that she would greet him when he came
again.</p>

<p>He entered the house, speaking first to the guardian
at the door, who assured him that all was well, and
then he entered the parlor.</p>

<p>He rang the silver call bell on the table, and a
servant entered.</p>

<p>“Your mistress?” said he.</p>

<p>“She is upstairs.”</p>

<p>Something in the servant’s tones attracted the detective,
and he bounded up the steps.</p>

<p>Into the girl’s boudoir he burst, to stop just beyond
the threshold.</p>

<p>One glance was enough—one look at the form lying
on the couch satisfied the detective, and he did not
remove the black-handled dagger from the blood-flecked
bosom.</p>

<p>Claude was found fast asleep and was taken away,
but the murderess was left alone.</p>

<p>The trail was ended.</p>

<p>Opal, the murderer of Mother Flintstone, was past
reach of judge or jury, and the court acquitted Claude,
for Bristol Clara, the only living witness, had to testify
in his favor.</p>

<p>George Richmond was tried for conspiracy, and, as
the law had long wanted to get another hold on him,
he was sent “up the river” for a long term, which
proved his last, for he died in Sing Sing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>The outcome of the detective’s trail was a startling
surprise to Gothamites and became the talk of the
town.</p>

<p>Margie Marne received a goodly share of the Lamont
wealth, and afterward married, while Mulberry
Billy, who played no insignificant part in the Mother
Flintstone affair, was placed beyond want by Margie,
who had formed an attachment for the boy.</p>

<p>It afterward turned out that Lewis Newell was a
man who once persecuted Opal with his attentions,
and the girl, with the coolness of a Borgia, decoyed him
to his doom and thus began her career of crime.</p>

<p>Carter was highly complimented upon the result of
his last trail, but he will never forget his adventure in
the dungeon to which he had been decoyed by the
daughter of the millionaire, nor the coolness with
which she met the terrible charge he brought home to
her under her own roof.</p>

<p class="center">THE END.</p>

<p>Our efforts to fill the enormous demand for scientific detective
literature at a reasonable price have been unceasing for the past
eight years. Any one who looks over the titles in the <b>New
Magnet Library</b> can hardly doubt that we have succeeded
splendidly in giving American readers the kind of mystery stories
that is usually found between cloth covers at $1.50. The price at
which these books are sold seems very insignificant in comparison
to the amount and quality of reading. Our watchword
in connection with this line is “never be content,” and it will be
our earnest endeavor to not only maintain the high standard of
excellence that prevails in the stories that we have published,
but to improve upon it. Every lover of detective stories will
rejoice in having this line brought to his attention because it
will place within his reach just the sort of literature that he
has been seeking.</p>

<p class="ph1">ALL TITLES ALWAYS IN PRINT</p>

<p>TO THE PUBLIC:—These books are sold by news dealers everywhere.
If your dealer does not keep them, and will not get them for
you, send direct to the publishers, in which case four cents must be
added to the price per copy to cover postage.</p>
